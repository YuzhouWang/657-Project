( @entity0 ) -- aquatic " dead zones " are a tragic illustration of human beings ' negative impact on the world 's oceans . they are areas so overloaded with pollutants that they have difficulty sustaining any life . the flow of fertilizers , sewage and industrial pollutants into rivers and seas has overloaded some coastal marine areas with nutrient waste such as nitrogen and phosphorus . this stimulates excessive growth of plants and algae , which use up oxygen dissolved in the water and kill off other marine life that depend on it . globally , their numbers are increasing , with more than 530 aquatic dead zones around the world , encompassing more than 95,000 square miles , according to the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) . some scientists believe climate change may also be making the situation worse . but help may be at hand thanks to the development of a number of technological solutions that aim to bring the dead zones back to life . scientists in @entity46 are testing an idea to pump oxygen into the @entity49 -- which separates @entity50 from mainland @entity51 and is the world 's largest man - made dead zone -- in an attempt to revive its dying ecosystem . the @entity49 region has suffered badly over the past 60 years from a rising flow of human and industrial waste . what 's more , because the @entity49 is largely enclosed , such harmful pollutants take longer to be washed out than in open waters . " as with all marine issues you do not see what is down there and sea bottoms are mostly neglected because in general people think there is no life , " said @entity63 , from environmental group @entity64 . " the effects of human behavior is many times reflected at the sea bottom and should be discussed with a louder voice . " attempts to reduce the waste being dumped into the @entity49 have so far failed to stop the growth of the dead zone , now equivalent to around one and half times the size of @entity84 . the lack of progress has led a number of @entity49 countries to consider technological interventions , or so - called " geoengineering " ideas ( large - scale solutions to environmental problems ) , such as pumping oxygen into the water , and using chemicals to bind pollutants in sediments , in a bid to save the @entity49 . the @entity46 government is funding research into the feasibility of using a wind - turbine driven oxygen pump in the @entity49 , following studies carried out last year by the @entity106 , which looked at the effect of pumping oxygen - rich surface water to the bottom of two @entity46 fjords . " today everyone is focused on reducing nutrient inputs to the sea in order to reduce eutrophication ( the effect of excessive nutrients ) in the @entity49 , but by helping nature itself to deal with the phosphorus that is discharged we can create a turbo effect in the battle against eutrophication , " said @entity111 , of the @entity106 's @entity112 . see also : floating turbine buoys offshore wind potential if implemented , the @entity129 ( @entity131 ) project would require around 100 pumping stations built around the @entity49 to transport oxygen deep underwater to counteract the declining amounts of oxygen and prevent the growth of the dead zone . however , not everyone is convinced by the geoengineering ideas . professor @entity141 from @entity142 in @entity46 , says they are " dangerous quick - fixes , " which could have a number of " unforeseen " consequences and allow countries to ignore their obligations for reducing the waste they dump in the @entity49 . " it could completely change the ecology of the @entity157 , " he said , adding that the oxygen - pumping plan could interfere with the reproductive successes of some fish species and cause the release of old contaminants buried underground . conversely , it could also raise water temperatures and stimulate higher algae growth . scientists in @entity46 are also testing the use of a chloride , used in treating drinking water
