( @entity0 ) -- who would n't expect great things from the world 's second largest land mass ? this is a nation hoarding enough prosperity , natural beauty and curling talent to serve a population a hundred times its size . but @entity11 is more than elbow room , good roads , respected banks , promo posters of @entity16 on horseback , sweet views of @entity18 and tired media frenzies about the odd crack - smoking mayor . this country could really brag about all the stuff that truly sets it apart . not that it ever would . self - effacing modesty is one the more endearing @entity11 virtues -- along with these 10 national assets that really put the " o " in @entity11 . 1 . apologizing it 's not so easy to get a simple apology in most of the world . being jostled in @entity32 . getting your foot stepped on in @entity35 . not having the door held open for you in @entity37 . that 's just all part of unrepentant life . in @entity11 , apologies happen constantly -- " sorries " flying in from all sides like swarms of affable killer bees . apologies are issued not just for some negligible mishap , but for actually having the gall to be on the receiving end of one . a @entity52 poll titled " sorry ... i 'm @entity11 , " found that 90 % of @entity11 aged 18 - 25 will immediately apologize if a stranger bumps into them . but while it may be true that some of the ugliest brawls in @entity11 have been waged over who 's sorrier , travelers should be wary of such niceties , notes another @entity11 apologist : " sometimes we 're actually expressing our sympathy for your shortcomings . " 2 . lakes and " @entity66 " @entity11 has more lakes than any other country -- about 3 million . the province of @entity70 alone contains about a third of the world 's freshwater , spread over 250,000 lakes . no surprise that " heading up to the lake " is more than just a favorite national phrase . it 's @entity11 's sacred version of lighting out for the territory -- but with cottages furnished with @entity82 chairs , @entity84 canoes and competing @entity85 and loon mating call soundtracks . recently , @entity70 's prime lake district , @entity82 , got the nod from @entity89 as the top summer destination -- in the world . well , yeah , eh ? it 's beauty up there . 3 . stand - in movie locations even if you 've never set foot in @entity97 , @entity98 or those handful of cities in between , you 've frequently been staring right at them without knowing it . why ? because @entity103 loves making movies in @entity11 -- big movies -- while passing the settings off as @entity106 , @entity107 , ancient @entity108 , the bow of history 's most ill - fated oceanliner ... basically anywhere else but @entity11 . if you 've sat through " @entity113 , " you 've visited @entity115 's @entity114 -- at least via celluloid . " @entity117 " ? that ai n't the @entity119 , pardner . it 's @entity122 's @entity121 country . " capote " ? you 're not in @entity124 , @entity125 . but @entity126 . " twilight " ? @entity97 . " @entity127 " ? @entity128 . " titanic " ? much of it filmed off the coast of @entity98 . and where in the world was @entity135 's shack in " @entity136 " ? just up the road from @entity138 in the @entity139 -- a moonscape - ish backcountry that 's also passed for @entity140 , @entity108 , @entity141 and @entity142 in several film and tv productions . 4 . air in a recent national air quality study by the @entity147 , @entity11 placed third for the cleanest air on the planet . until the first and second placers ( @entity153 and @entity154 ) are covered in @entity0 's " better than anywhere else " series , we direct your breath to @entity11 cities -- which average a relatively pristine 13 micrograms of @entity161 particles per cubic meter . 5 . humor @entity11 are hilarious -- sometimes even intentionally -- as a disproportionate number of comic heavyweights like @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and so many others have repeatedly confirmed over the years . what makes @entity11 so crazy funny ? the subject has launched sociological studies , none of which are funny at all . but even if you 've never watched @entity183 , ca n't name a single member of " @entity185 " and were n't aware that @entity186 was created and produced by a @entity115 , or that @entity128 's @entity187 is the world 's biggest comedy festival , or that the most deadly funny movie sequence ever filmed ( the " @entity191 ! " scene from 1979 's " @entity193 " ) was directed by a dude from @entity195 -- know this : if there 's one thing @entity11 barrels superbly at home or abroad , for whatever boring reason , it 's laughs . 6 . chocolate bars just a few giant corporations pump out most of the world 's mass market candy bars -- but not always with the same goods under that familiar - looking wrapper .
