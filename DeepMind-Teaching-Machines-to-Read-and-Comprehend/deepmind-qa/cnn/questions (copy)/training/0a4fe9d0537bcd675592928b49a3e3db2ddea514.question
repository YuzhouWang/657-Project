( @entity0 ) -- some in the pro-immigrant left are confused . they ca n't make up their minds about @entity5 citizenship . is it a necessity or a luxury ? is it vitally important to living a full life or something one can live without ? should it be respected and treasured or rejected and trivialized ? do n't expect @entity13 to be of much help in sorting this out . in making public policy , especially on the tough issues , my home state can often be emotional , egotistical and erratic . just last week , the @entity20 approved @entity21 , a bill that would allow noncitizens to serve on juries if they are in the country legally . the vote , 45 to 26 , was n't even close . all the " yes " votes came from @entity29 . no surprise there . getting noncitizens on juries is the first step toward what @entity29 are really after -- getting more of them to vote , at least in non-federal elections . in november 2010 , voters in @entity39 weighed in on a proposition that would have allowed all parents of children in the city 's schools to vote in school board elections whether they were citizens or not ; they voted it down but the shocking part is that it was even proposed . still , if the bill is approved by the @entity50 and signed by gov. @entity51 , @entity13 would become the first state in the nation to dispense with the citizenship requirement to sit on a jury . what 's wrong with this picture ? what happened to all the rhetoric we 've heard in the debate over comprehensive immigration reform , about how advocates wo n't settle for the undocumented getting only legal status because " citizenship " is so wonderful and valuable ? just not essential to acts of civic participation like sitting on juries . supporters say they want to increase the size of the available jury pool while helping immigrants integrate into @entity5 society . they also claim that juries should reflect their communities as they exist , and this means including noncitizens in the mix. those are lovely sentiments . but if people want to help immigrants " integrate , " they should help them become @entity5 citizens . it 's not that difficult . the hard part is going from " illegal immigrant " to " legal resident " ; by comparison , transitio
