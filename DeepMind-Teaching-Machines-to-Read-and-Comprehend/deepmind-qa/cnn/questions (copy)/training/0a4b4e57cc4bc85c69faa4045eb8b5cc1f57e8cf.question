" " yesterday , she was so exhausted and she wanted to take a quick nap . she kept asking me : ' are you going to be here when i come back ? ' " the sister said thursday . emotions have run high in @entity26 's home as well , @entity1 said . watch the journalists ' family reunions » " i hear from @entity4 's husband , @entity100 , that @entity101 , their 4 - year - old daughter , has not wanted her mother to leave her sight , " she said .

" @entity1 said her sibling will soon share her " powerful " story , perhaps in an op - ed piece , but she needs space right now . @entity1 , meanwhile , is elated that her sister and @entity26 are safe . she said she always knew they would come home .
