( @entity0 ) -- " what do you call a @entity4 driver with a speeding ticket ? a liar . " @entity7 might not have heard that old joke about the much - maligned car , an icon of the @entity12 era , but it might give him a chuckle . " i had a @entity21 lada , " the @entity15 star revealed as he took @entity0 's @entity16 for a spin in a flashy sports car provided by his team @entity19 . " i got it from a friend of ours . we changed the engine . it was perfect for us -- free of charge and a very robust car . " it was red but we painted it black . it never broke down . " the @entity33 now drives one of the world 's fastest vehicles on the @entity15 racetrack -- which he definitely would n't be allowed to paint black -- but the down - to - earth approach of his first car beautifully sums up his underlying normality . the man they call the " @entity7 " is @entity15 's most reluctant star . the 34 - year - old is known for his succinct , cool answers when facing the media . and while he does n't say much , he often says what he thinks . perhaps his most famous admission came in 2006 when he explained he missed the presentation for the retiring @entity49 , the man he was going to replace at @entity19 the following year , because he was in the bathroom -- or words to that effect . then there are the off - track headlines , like the time he was filmed falling off a boat during a party . @entity7 's pithy comments and antics have made him a cult icon among @entity15 fans but he insists he would rather stay out of the spotlight . " it 'd be perfect to lead a normal life where nobody notices you , " he tells @entity0 . " but obviously you can not have both . " racing and driving is the main thing but there 's a lot of other stuff that comes with it . " i 've been long enough in the business to know that it 's a big part of it . for me , it 's not much fun . " i 'm not a big fan of going places and showing off , i 'd rather do my own things . i never try to hide it because it is how it is . " unlike many other drivers on the grid , @entity7 is also refreshingly honest about his childhood ambitions while growing up in the city of @entity90 . " i would n't say i wanted to become a @entity15 driver straight away , " he explains . " i actually started out with motocross when i was a small boy and then go - karts . it was good fun and you start wanting more . " but i still did n't believe that i would even make it to @entity15 because we did n't have the money . " i just thought i 'd do karts for as long as possible and then do something else . " that something else was two titles in the @entity103 . after just 23 races , @entity7 was signed up by @entity105 and fast - tracked into @entity15 for the 2001 season . he won his first grand prix with @entity108 in 2003 and his first and only world title with @entity19 in 2007 before the @entity111 team effectively paid up the rest of his salary to bring in @entity114 for the 2010 season . officially retired from @entity15 , @entity7 flexed his driving muscles in the @entity117 and got behind the wheel for two @entity120 races . his team radio in the @entity123 series endeared him to new fans with such quotable outbursts as : " i do n't understand how
