( @entity0 ) -- on a cold morning in february , 10 days after undergoing in vitro fertilization , @entity1 lay in bed at her @entity5 home waiting for the results of her pregnancy test . @entity9 and @entity1 with daughter @entity10 ( now 18 months ) and sons @entity8 , left , and @entity12 . @entity13 was moving slowly . it was getting late and the call from the fertility clinic should have come by lunchtime . " we were waiting and waiting and the call seemed like it would never come , " @entity1 said . finally , around 4 p.m. , @entity1 's husband , @entity9 , got the call at work . " the doctor told me in one sentence , ' @entity1 is pregnant , but we transferred the wrong embryos , ' " he said . " i did n't even know that could physically happen . it was a total shock , totally beyond the realm of possibility . " in a tragic mix - up , the @entity30 say the fertility clinic where @entity1 underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple 's embryos into @entity1 's uterus . in essence , she had become an unwitting surrogate for another family . after receiving the news , @entity9 hung up the phone and drove straight home to tell his wife in person . " he walked in and was as white as a sheet , " @entity1 said . " he told me , and i think he repeated himself two or three times , and i kept saying ' you 're joking . ' i kept yelling at him stop it but there was nothing on his face indicating a joke . " watch more on the @entity30 and their reaction to their situation Â» @entity55 turned to shock , and when that shock melted , so did the couple 's hope for having another child of their own . at the time , @entity1 was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning . " that was the beginning of a very treacherous and emotional journey for us , " said @entity9 . " i do n't think i 've ever cried so much in my life , " said @entity1 . " it was such a nightmare and , in a way , i felt violated . " that nightmare was the tipping point on a pregnancy path marred by failed attempts and painful miscarriages . only the birth of the @entity30 ' first child was easy . their second child , born almost three years later in 1997 , was 10 weeks premature after @entity1 developed life - threatening complications . " that was a scary time for us , " said @entity1 . yet after she recovered , the @entity30 consulted with a doctor and remained intent on pursuing future pregnancies . it would prove exceedingly difficult . @entity1 and @entity9 tried on and off for 10 years to have another child before turning to @entity87 . eventually , @entity1 became pregnant with the couple 's third child , resulting in another difficult pregnancy and premature birth . their daughter is now a healthy 18 - month - old . with five embryos left over from @entity87 -- and despite the risks to @entity1 's health -- the @entity30 , guided by their religious beliefs , refused to let the unused embryos at the clinic la
