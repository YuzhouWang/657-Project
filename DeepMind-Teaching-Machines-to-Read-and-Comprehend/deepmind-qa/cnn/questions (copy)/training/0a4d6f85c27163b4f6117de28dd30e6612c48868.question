@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- rapid advances in communications are eroding police departments ' abilities to conduct wiretaps , and @entity7 needs to take steps to ensure that new telephone , computer and wireless systems are designed to allow lawful police access , @entity13 and police officials told @entity7 thursday . but other witnesses cautioned that any such move could stifle innovation , place @entity20 technology companies at a competitive disadvantage and unintentionally create systems vulnerable to hackers , criminals and terrorists . at issue is the diminished capability of law enforcement agencies to conduct quick wiretaps in an age of @entity32 accounts , @entity34 and @entity35 pages , @entity31 , @entity36 , iphones and @entity38 . the @entity39 calls the phenomenon " going dark . " in testimony before a @entity44 subcommittee , @entity13 general counsel @entity41 said it is " exponentially more difficult " to execute court - authorized wiretaps on new technology , noting that criminals can now communicate using wireless devices and anonymous avatars . @entity41 said the @entity13 is not seeking additional authority to conduct wiretaps , but rather is looking for solutions to technical problems the agency encounters in conducting court - authorized intercepts . the @entity60 administration currently has no proposal to increase the technological ease of wiretapping , she said , but she added that one may be coming soon . a 1994 law , the @entity65 , required telephone companies to build in the means to conduct intercepts . but the law was designed to keep pace with changes in telecommunications , not in internet - based communications services , and is now antiquated , she said . as an example , @entity41 cites a 2009 case in which a pimp used a social networking site to entice children into prostitution . investigators had enough evidence for a court - ordered wiretap , but did not seek one because the website did not provide a means of conducting electronic surveillance , she wrote . " there are a lot of things that keep me up at night . one thing is the privacy of people who are communicating on the @entity93 , " @entity41 said . " but i also get kept up by worrying that we 've got criminals running around that we ca n't arrest and ca n't prosecute because we ca n't actually execute a wiretap order . and that criminal may be a massive drug dealer . they may be an arms traffi
