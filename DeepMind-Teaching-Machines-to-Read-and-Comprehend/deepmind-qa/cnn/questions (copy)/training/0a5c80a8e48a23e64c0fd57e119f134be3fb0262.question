the @entity4 government has obtained a top secret court order that requires @entity6 to turn over the telephone records of millions of @entity4 to the @entity8 on an " ongoing daily basis , " the @entity2 - based @entity1 newspaper reported wednesday . the four - page order , which @entity1 published on its website , requires the communications giant to turn over " originating and terminating " telephone numbers as well as the location , time and duration of the calls . the order , published on the newspaper 's website , does not require the contents of conversations to be turned over . @entity22 has so far been unable to independently verify the authenticity of the document . if genuine , the order gives the @entity8 blanket access to the records of millions of @entity6 customers ' domestic and foreign phone calls made between april 25 , when the order was signed , and july 19 , when it expires . @entity6 spokesman @entity32 declined to comment on the report . according to the document published by @entity1 , @entity35 ( @entity35 ) court judge @entity34 signed a " @entity37 " granting an @entity39 request for access to the records . the @entity39 did not respond to a @entity22 request for comment . the @entity8 told @entity22 said it will respond " as soon as we can . " the order does not say why the request was made , but it bans the government and @entity6 from making the contents public . " as far as we know , this order from the @entity35 court is the broadest surveillance order to ever have been issued : it requires no level of suspicion and applies to all @entity6 subscribers anywhere in the @entity4 , " the @entity49 said in a statement released shortly after the story broke . " it also contains a gag order prohibiting @entity6 from disclosing information about the order to anyone other than their counsel . " former vice president @entity64 also criticized the move . " in the digital era , privacy must be a priority . is it just me , or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous ? " he said in a post on @entity71 . the order is allowed under the @entity75 , and it is not the first time such an action has been taken . in 2006 , it was revealed that the @entity8 was secretly collecting telephone records as part of an effort to root out potential terror plots . reacting to wednesday 's disclosure , the @entity84 called for an immediate end to the order and a congressional investigation into the move . " it 's a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents , " @entity90 , the @entity84 's deputy legal director , said . " it is beyond @entity97 , and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence a
