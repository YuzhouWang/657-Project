( @entity0 ) -- a @entity2 model , who is set to become the first woman in the @entity6 country to be caned for drinking alcohol in public , wants her punishment carried out in public . @entity11 says that if a caning is meant to teach a lesson , then it should be in public . @entity11 said thursday that if the intent of the @entity18 , or @entity19 , court that sentenced her was to set an example for other @entity23 , then the flogging should take place in the open . " let 's be transparent about it , " she said . " we want to challenge them , " added @entity11 's father , @entity27 . " the law is a little bit wrong . they say they are gentlemen who want to uphold values . then the public should judge how gentlemanly it is . " an @entity18 court in the eastern state of @entity39 fined @entity11 $ 1,400 ( 5,000 @entity2 ringgit ) and sentenced her to six strokes with a rattan cane for drinking beer at a hotel bar two years ago . @entity11 , a 32 - year - old part - time model , was visiting @entity2 from @entity46 , where she lives with her husband and two children . she pleaded guilty and has paid the fine . @entity2 , which considers itself a moderate @entity23 country , forbids alcohol consumption by @entity23 -- even those who are visiting . the country has a dual - track justice system , in which @entity18 courts operate alongside civil ones . the law forbidding alcohol applies only to @entity23 , who make up about 60 percent of the population . the country 's @entity61 , @entity62 or @entity63 population can drink freely . @entity11 's case has caused an uproar , with many citing it as another example of growing fundamentalism in the multiracial country . in northern @entity2 's @entity73 state , authorities have forbidden @entity23 women from wearing bright lipstick and noisy , high - heeled shoes , saying the ban will safeguard the morals and dignity of the women , as well as thwart rape . " we want to present a face to the world that we are not a fundamentalist country , " @entity82 , said a resident in @entity84 . " this makes us a laughingstock . " @entity91 , president of the @entity19 [ @entity19 ] @entity92 of @entity2 , said too much is being made of @entity11 's punishment . " it is not about causing pain . it is about educating others and to teach the person a lesson , " he said . the recipient is fully clothed and the flogger can not raise his arm high , @entity91 said . the blows are delivered using a thin stick , so that they do n't break the skin . @entity2 's civil court does not call for caning for alcohol consumption . it also can not overrule a @entity19 court sentence . the civil courts do , however , hand out flogging sentences for serious offenses such as rape . neighboring @entity46 also metes out caning as punishment . one of the most notable cases was that of @entity120 teenager @entity119 , who received four strokes for vandalism in 1994 . @entity11 's punishment is unique because she has opted to go through with it , which would make her the first woman to be caned for drinking alcohol in public , @entity91 said . two other @entity2 sentenced to the same fate have filed appeals . @entity11 will be taken from her father 's house monday . the caning will be carried out within seven
