@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity4 leaders named @entity0 prime minister @entity5 as the first " president of @entity7 " thursday , edging out former @entity9 prime minister @entity8 for a still - vaguely defined job . " i did not seek this high position , and i did n't take any steps to achieve it , " @entity5 said in accepting the job . " but tonight , i take on this task with conviction and with enthusiasm . " @entity5 , a 62 - year - old , soft - spoken fan of @entity19 poetry , will become the face of @entity4 and represent its 27 member nations at summits overseas . his conservative government took office in december 2008 . the @entity0 is " well known as a consensus builder , " said @entity9 prime minister @entity27 , who added the selection was unanimous . and @entity29 , the president of the @entity30 -- the executive arm of the @entity4 -- called @entity5 's selection " a tribute to @entity0 , " the @entity4 's host country . " i think the @entity4 also expressed its gratitude for the work of @entity0 and the constant support that this country at the heart of @entity7 has given to our common project , " he said . in his speech , @entity5 pledged to lead the @entity4 through a process of " dialogue , unity and action . " " a negotiation that ends with a defeated party is never a good negotiation , " he said . " as president of the council , i will listen carefully to everyone , and i will make sure that all deliberations turn into results for everyone . " the presidency was created by the @entity4 's @entity56 , which came into force this month after years of torturous negotiations . @entity5 will serve a two - and - a - half - year term , replacing the six - month presidency of the bloc that rotated among the heads of its member states . but while the @entity4 prides itself on being a club of democracies , the process of choosing its new leader was far from transparent or open . the people of @entity7 are getting no say , not even through their parliamentarians . @entity5 's new job was announced after a closed - door dinner for the @entity4 's heads of state and government . the @entity0 defended the process , telling reporters the selection was made by leaders " who were all democratically chosen . " " i was chosen on the basis of a treaty , " he said . " the treaty stipulates the procedure . the treaty was democratically approved by 27 member states . " the @entity4 leaders also named @entity87 , a @entity9 trade commissioner and member of the @entity89 , as the union 's high commissioner -- its equivalent of a foreign minister . unlike @entity5 , who was chosen by leaders of the @entity4 's member states , @entity94 must be confirmed by the @entity97 . @entity8 , who led @entity9 from 1997 to 2007 , is currently the @entity4 's @entity98 envoy . he had been the early favorite for the presidency in recent weeks -- but @entity27 , his successor , realized that he lacked support among key decision - makers for new post , a @entity27 representative told @entity2 earlier . according his backers , who at first included @entity107 president @entity106 , he was just the sort of world - renowned figure to win attention for the @entity4 and enable it to exercise its weight in world affairs . one @entity115 official told @entity2 before the announcement , " if the @entity4 chooses as its worldwide representative the prime minister of @entity0 or @entity118 , i am not sure our leaders will have the time to meet him . " but others were soon arguing that @entity8 's support for the @entity126 - led invasion of @entity127 and his close alliance with former @entity126 president @entity129 made him a divisive figure in @entity7 . and as the one man who might have been able to take @entity9 into the @entity7 single currency , he had not even attempted to do so while he was @entity9 's prime minister . public backing from @entity136 's @entity135 , a joke figure to much of @entity7 and another @entity129 ally , did not help . @entity27 had realized earlier that @entity8 did not have enough support among key decision - makers to snag the new post , a @entity27 representative told @entity2 earlier . @entity2 political contributor @entity143 contributed to this report .
