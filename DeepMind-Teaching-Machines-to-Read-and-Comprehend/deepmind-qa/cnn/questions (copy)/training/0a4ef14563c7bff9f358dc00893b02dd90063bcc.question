( @entity0 ) -- @entity4 officers knew that @entity5 had been arrested in 2004 for shooting out the tires of a car -- in a blackout fueled by anger -- and yet they admitted him into the @entity4 and granted him security clearance anyway , a senior @entity2 officer told @entity0 . " it appears as if investigators were aware of the incident , interviewed him and were satisfied that it did not preclude granting the clearance , " the officer said . @entity5 , who killed 12 people monday at the @entity20 , was a military contractor who used a valid identification to gain access to the secured facility , law enforcement officials said tuesday . but experts , lawmakers and many in the media are now asking how @entity5 was able to obtain that clearance , given his previous run - ins with the law -- some involving guns -- as well his checkered past in the @entity4 and a history of mental illness . did government background investigations dig up the things about @entity5 that news agencies managed to find out within hours ? experts weigh in @entity5 " should have been screened out early on in his enlistment , " said one expert on @entity4 processes , who asked not to be identified . " the @entity4 and the various entities responsible for his adjudication were either unwilling or worse unable to determine he was unfit for service in the @entity4 . " the incidents in @entity5 ' past " should have been a red flag that maybe we need to delve a little deeper into this individual , " said retired @entity53 . @entity54 . 2008 arrest led to @entity5 ' @entity4 discharge and private experts told @entity58 should n't have kept his clearance . " in all of my experience with this , he absolutely should not have gotten a clearance . anybody that i 've encountered with any kind -- even half of this record -- does not get a clearance , " said private attorney @entity64 , who specializes in clearance cases . the gun arrests alone should have disqualified him , @entity64 said . a checkered past the shooter at the @entity20 had a " pattern of misconduct " as a @entity4 reservist and sporadic run - ins with the law , and had contacted two @entity77 hospitals for apparent psychological issues , sources have told @entity0 . @entity5 told police he was hearing voices at around 8 in the morning on may 6 , 2004 , @entity5 used his @entity83 to shoot out two of the tires of a 1986 @entity86 near a @entity88 , @entity89 , home where @entity5 was residing . he was ultimately arrested and charged with " malicious mischief . " @entity5 said that the owners of the car " had disrespected him " and that , he claimed , led " to what @entity5 described as a ' black - out ' fueled by anger , " according to the police report . @entity5 also was arrested on a gun - related offense in 2010 as well as on a disorderly charge in 2008 , but he was never prosecuted . also , although he was honorably discharged as a @entity4 reservist , he had at least eight instances of misconduct while on duty , according to a @entity105 defense official . so why was he given clearance ? " the way it happens is a poor background check , " says @entity107 , a former @entity108 counterterrorism agent . @entity4 officials are going back to see if his clearance should have been pulled . " we 're looking at his entire service record , " @entity4 spokesman rear adm. @entity114 told @entity0 's @entity115 . " @entity118 flags , if any , were missed , and if there 's an accounting to be done . " how clearance works contractors can receive three levels of clearance : confidential , secret and top secret . @entity5 had secret clearance , the middle category . @entity20 shooting : what we know and do n't know a @entity131 office oversees clearance . applicants fill out a very long form , which asks about any contact with police , charges and convictions . the form also asks about mental instability . interviews with applicants follow . before obtaining clearance as a contractor , @entity5 would have theoretically been investigated by the @entity144 and ultimately granted clearance by " @entity146 " -- the @entity148 's @entity147 , in @entity149 , @entity150 . an official at @entity146 refused to comment , referring @entity0 to the @entity131 . @entity114 told @entity0 he could n't speak for @entity146 or its process , but @entity5 " passed a routine security clearance back in 2007 when he en
