( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 soccer officials hope to take their showpiece tournament to the @entity4 in 2016 for a centenary celebration that could have big benefits for all concerned , but this week 's announcement appears to be somewhat premature . @entity8 , which runs the game in @entity10 and @entity11 and the @entity12 , said talks regarding what would be a historic tournament are still ongoing , though it is open to the possibility of having the likes of superstars @entity19 and @entity21 parading their skills in front of sellout crowds . world governing body @entity25 has also yet to sanction the event -- which would involve 10 @entity2 nations , the @entity4 and @entity28 plus four other countries from the @entity8 region -- in the busy international calendar . the @entity32 , which has featured guest nations from @entity8 since 1993 , was last staged in 2011 -- when it was won by @entity34 . the next edition is due to be held in @entity36 in 2015 , one year after it hosts the @entity37 , while the @entity39 federation hopes to stage an additional @entity32 in the @entity4 12 months later to mark the ruling body 's 100th year of existence .

" the @entity4 television money for big soccer tournaments is now quite large -- the @entity4 rights for 2018 and @entity74 went for a combined $ 1.1 billion , which will probably be the highest rights fee for any nation in the world , " @entity65 told @entity0 . " there are big questions in terms of will @entity25 sanction an event like this and put it on the official calendar ? will @entity25 require clubs to release their players for it ? none of that has been made public in terms of any agreements . " can @entity91 help @entity93 reign in @entity94 ? the opportunity to compete against teams such as @entity36 and @entity97 , boasting the likes of @entity21 and @entity19 , is one which @entity65 feel
