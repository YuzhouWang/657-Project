dozens of armed men seized the regional government administration buildings in @entity5 's southern @entity4 region thursday and raised the @entity7 flag in a challenge to the @entity11 country 's new leaders . @entity4 , a @entity13 peninsula with an ethnic @entity7 majority , is the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership in the capital , @entity19 , after president @entity21 's ouster saturday . the seizure , coming a day after @entity7 ordered surprise military exercises on @entity5 's doorstep , has raised fears about the push and pull of opposing allegiances in a country sandwiched between @entity7 and the @entity30 . there 's a broad divide between those who support developments in @entity19 -- where parliament was voting on an interim @entity37 - leaning , national unity government thursday -- and those who back @entity7 's continued influence in @entity4 and across @entity5 . @entity21 issued a defiant statement to @entity7 news agencies condemning the interim government in @entity19 and calling everything happening now in the @entity5 parliament illegitimate , @entity7 state news agency @entity40 reported thursday . according to @entity40 , anonymous government sources said thursday that @entity21 was in @entity7 and that @entity7 authorities have accepted his request for security . a warrant has been issued for his arrest in @entity5 . @entity21 will give a news conference friday in the southern @entity7 city of @entity55 , @entity7 state media reported . if so , it would be the first time he 's been seen in public since fleeing @entity19 . @entity59 has not independently confirmed @entity21 's whereabouts . secession fears about @entity4 concerns are building that the tensions in the autonomous @entity4 region might escalate into a bid for separation by its @entity7 majority . pro-russian members of the @entity4 parliament dismissed the government of @entity4 premier @entity73 in a vote of no confidence thursday , his spokesman @entity68 told @entity59 . he said @entity73 would respect the parliament 's decision , despite many procedural irregularities . the lawmakers also voted for a referendum on may 25 on greater autonomy for the region within @entity5 territory , he said . only @entity85 lawmakers were present in the parliament building , still occupied by apparently pro-russian gunmen . @entity68 quoted @entity73 as saying the responsibility for @entity4 's future stability rests with parliament . @entity4 was handed to @entity5 by the @entity91 in 1954 . just over half its population is ethnic @entity7 , while about a quarter are @entity5 and a little more than 10 % are @entity94 , a group oppressed under former @entity91 leader @entity96 . many are struggling to come to grips with the rapid political upheaval , and scuffles have broken out between rival groups -- one pro-russian and the other supporting the new authorities in @entity19 -- in the @entity4 capital of @entity104 . new @entity5 prime minister 's appointment back in @entity19 , lawmakers approved opposition leader @entity108 of the @entity109 , or @entity110 , party as prime minister . @entity108 , who has been both economic and foreign minister in past governments , told reporters that @entity21 " is no longer the president , he is the person under investigation and accused of crimes against humanity , " state news agency @entity113 reported . the new prime minister told parliament that he can not promise to turn things around quickly and that there is likely to be pain in the short term as the cash - strapped country seeks to get back on track . he also made clear that he believes the country 's future rests in closer ties to @entity134 , not @entity7 . " the key task for the @entity5 government is @entity11 integration , " he said . " it means a visa - free regime for the @entity5 citizens , and it means an agreement with the @entity30 on political and economic integration ; agreement on a fully fledged free trade zone . the future of @entity5 is in @entity134 , and @entity5 will become a member of the @entity30 . " @entity21 's decision to scrap a @entity30 trade deal in favor of one with @entity7 prompted the protests , which began in november . those protests devolved last week into bloody street clashes between demonstrators and security forces that left more than 80 people dead . @entity158 chief @entity157 said thursday her organization was ready to respond to a request for assistance from @entity5 authorities and would send a fact - finding team to @entity5 to assess the situation and discuss potential reforms . " we are also discussing with all our international partners -- bilateral and multilateral -- how best to help @entity5 at this critical moment in its history , " she said . @entity5 authorities anticipate the country will need about $ 35 billion in foreign assistance by the end of 2015 . @entity174 concerns about @entity7 military exercises as @entity5 's interim leaders work to restore stability , @entity174 defense secretary @entity178 , speaking at a meeting of @entity181 defense ministers in @entity182 , @entity183 , urged all parties to avoid " provocative actions " in @entity5 . and he warned that the @entity174 was keeping a sharp eye on @entity7 in light of its recent moves . " i 'm closely watching @entity7 's military exercises along the @entity5 border , " he said . " i expect @entity7 to be transparent about these activities , and i urge them not to take any steps that could be misinterpreted or lead to miscalculations . " this , he said , " is a time for very calm , wise leadership on the @entity7 side , on everyone 's side here . " @entity174 officials earlier told @entity59 that the @entity7 military exercises were making @entity174 military and intelligence agencies concerned that @entity7 may be positioning ground forces to be able to move across the border into @entity5 if @entity207 issued such orders . @entity7 defense minister @entity209 has said the exercises are being conducted to check " combat readiness . " @entity174 secretary of state @entity212 said his @entity7 counterpart , foreign minister @entity213 , offered reassurances thursday that military exercises were previously scheduled and not related to @entity5 . " we believe that everybody now needs to step back and avoid any kind of provocations , and we want to see in the next days ahead obviously that the choices @entity7 makes conform to this affirmation that we received today , " he said after a phone conversation with @entity213 . " we are also making the same point about reducing tensions in the @entity4 to the @entity5 . it is very important that the process continue in a thoughtful and respectful way . " opinion : will @entity5 's @entity4 region be @entity134 's next ' frozen ' conflict ? no negotiations in @entity10
