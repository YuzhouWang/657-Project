one year ago , @entity0 , the former @entity1 presidential contender and avatar of progressive sentiment , sat in a hotel lobby at the annual @entity6 conference in @entity7 and held forth on @entity10 's @entity9 chances in 2016 . @entity0 made news . @entity18 " will not get a pass " in the 2016 @entity1 primaries if she decides to run again , @entity0 said , an early warning shot from the left against the party establishment 's anointed front - runner . @entity0 said he might make a repeat @entity9 bid of his own , promising to agitate " other politicians " in the race on issues precious to liberals . stepping up her game , @entity18 agrees to help in midterms how things have changed . today , @entity0 still thinks @entity18 will have a challenger in the @entity1 field -- maybe several . but he wo n't be one of them . and if @entity18 does run , @entity0 sounds like he 's ready to join the team . " i am a huge @entity10 fan , " @entity0 told @entity36 in an interview . " i just am . not because i hope to get a job . i know her ; i 've known her for a long time . i think she has an enormous mental capacity to do analysis and let the chips fall where they may . " " if she is president , which i hope she is , i think she is going to be a terrific president , " added @entity0 , who stopped into @entity18 's book signing event in the @entity46 last weekend and posed for a picture with the former secretary of state . the kind words from @entity0 are n't quite an endorsement in the traditional campaign sense , but praise from one of the left 's most recognizable figures is sure to please @entity18 allies who are working to build up an aura of inevitability around her and blunt a serious primary challenge . the @entity64 has already secured pseudo-endorsements from @entity67 sen. @entity66 and @entity69 's two senators , @entity70 and @entity71 . opinion : can @entity10 win over the left ? @entity18 's incremental politics do n't quite square with those of @entity0 , who rose to national prominence in 2004 as a fierce and noisy critic of the war in @entity79 , a military action supported by @entity18 . while @entity18 is not the cold - blooded foreign policy hawk she 's often caricatured as -- she 's a devotee of so - called " smart power " and institution - building -- her @entity79 war vote in 2002 and her occasional splits with president @entity88 on @entity89 and @entity90 have not endeared her to her party 's anti-interventionist wing . her differences with @entity88 resurfaced last week in an interview with the @entity98 's @entity97 . @entity18 drew a line between her own views and the president 's cautious foreign policy realism , expressing concern over the administration 's handling of the civil war in @entity89 . she said , " great nations need organizing principles -- and ' do n't do stupid stuff ' is not an organizing principle . " the remark ricocheted around the @entity113 , and @entity18 called the president to make amends . @entity0 , though , aggressively took @entity18 's side . " how can she not triangulate ? she is running for @entity120 , " the former @entity119 governor said . " you think if she comes out as a clone of anybody she has any chance at winning ? people do n't want clones as president . so of course she is going to say stuff that 's different . so what ? this is news ? " his aggressive defense of @entity18 bloomed into a lengthy rant against the state of the political news media and the " amplification chamber " that @entity18 will have to navigate if she decides to run . @entity18 dances between loyalty and self - interest " i find all that to be worthless , " @entity0 said . " i do n't pay any attention to that crap . i was at a meeting in @entity146 the other day with two very high - ranking people who i wo n't mention , and one turned to the other and said , ' did you see that editorial in the @entity152 ? ' and without being cranky , and without saying anything , i said to myself , ' you 're a free man . ' because why would anyone read the @entity152 , or certainly the editorial page of the @entity152 ? " i just do n't have any patience for this @entity158 that goes on in what passes for media these days . i really do n't read most of the stuff that 's written about inside the @entity163 kerfuffles like that because i think it 's silly . " @entity18 's biggest challenge will be generational , @entity0 said , echoing a previous observation he 's made about the putative @entity1 front - runner . @entity18 is 14 years older than @entity88 and would be 69 on @entity169 2017 . " @entity10 , she has been on the scene since , what , 1992 ? " he said . " to elect @entity10 , the country would have to do something we 've only done once in my lifetime , with @entity177 over @entity178 , which is the country would have to go back a generation . usually , you do n't go back . " still , he said @entity18 " might be a great candidate because of that . " " it 's fairly likely the @entity186 are going to nominate somebody who
