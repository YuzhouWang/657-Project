( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 have qualified for the last 16 of the @entity2 as @entity4 winners , despite being held 1 - 1 at home to @entity6 on tuesday . @entity1 went into the match on the verge of creating history . no side had ever gone through all six group games without conceding a goal -- but a clean sheet against their @entity15 visitors would have seen the @entity18 giants achieve that feat. however , that dream died in the 32nd minute when @entity21 lost the ball to @entity23 -- who perfectly teed up @entity24 to give @entity6 the lead . with both teams already qualifying for the knockout stages , a @entity6 win would have seen them go through as group winners . and they remained on course for the three points until the 63rd minute when @entity37 scored a rare goal to earn @entity1 a draw , the @entity31 midfielder reacting quickest after @entity33 's shot was parried by goalkeeper @entity40 . @entity42 champions @entity41 finished third in the group -- and take the @entity45 place in the process -- after drawing 1 - 1 at @entity47 . top scorer @entity48 opened the scoring for the visitors in the 19th minute when he superbly lashed home a left - footed shot from 12 yards out . but the @entity54 hosts collected their first - ever @entity2 point when @entity56 stabbed the ball past goalkeeper @entity58 with 11 minutes left . defending champions @entity59 had already qualified for the knockout stages , but their run of poor form continued as they were thrashed 3 - 0 at @entity63 in @entity64 a @entity66 header and a @entity68 volley sealed the points for the @entity71 side , with @entity72 adding the third near the end . a victory would have seen @entity76 's side go through as group winners , but their heaviest defeat in @entity79 for five years allowed @entity80 to win the group on 11 points after a thrilling 3 - 3 draw at @entity84 . an end - to - end encounter saw @entity80 go ahead when 40 - year - old goalkeeper @entity86 completely missed
