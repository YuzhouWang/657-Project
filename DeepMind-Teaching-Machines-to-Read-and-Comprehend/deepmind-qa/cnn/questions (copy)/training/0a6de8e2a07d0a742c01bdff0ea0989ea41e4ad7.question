( @entity0 ) -- a flooring contractor from @entity2 , @entity3 , received news he had dreamed of for more than a year when a @entity7 judge released him on bail tuesday . @entity10 wore a white bulletproof vest as he spoke with reporters after the hearing . supporters of the businessman , 53 , who had been imprisoned for 18 months , say he faces death threats for exposing @entity7 government corruption connected with the case against him . " his life remains at risk every day that he remains in @entity7 , " @entity21 rep. @entity20 , @entity22 , said in a statement tuesday . @entity10 was arrested in june 2011 on suspicion of money laundering tied to a rice - growing operation . he has denied the accusations and has claimed for months that corrupt officials had trumped up the case . @entity7 authorities arrested six government officials last month , accusing them of trying to extort and steal from @entity10 . now some of his one - time accusers -- including former employees of the attorney general 's office and the country 's interior ministry -- are behind bars in the same prison where he was held . @entity7 's state - run @entity42 news agency has described that facility -- the @entity45 prison in @entity46 , @entity7 -- as the country 's " most dangerous and overcrowded . " on tuesday , @entity10 was released on bail of 100,000 bolivianos ( about $ 14,200 ) , and now will be in more comfortable conditions , although the case against him has n't been dropped . he will remain under house arrest from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. , judge @entity51 ruled tuesday , but can move freely at other times . @entity20 and @entity21 rep. @entity54 , @entity55 - @entity3 , praised @entity10 's release as the " first positive development " in the case . " but this is only @entity60 , " @entity20 said . " @entity10 has incurred permanent damage to his health and has lost over 18 precious months of his life with his wife , children and grandchildren . " after the hearing , an ambulance transported @entity10 to a clinic where he is being treated for @entity70 , @entity42 reported . in an interview with @entity0 en @entity73 ± ol from a hospital bed earlier this month , @entity10 said he was wearing a bulletproof vest out of fear for his safety , even as officials had been arrested in the corruption probe connected with his case . " actually i feel much less safe . that 's why you see me sleeping with this bulletproof vest , " he said . " because now there are some officials in prison . " the detention of @entity10 , who at one point went on a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment , drew international attention . actor @entity92 sat at his side last week , calling for his release . speaking to reporters tuesday , @entity10 said his case was only one of many in the @entity100 country . " i want @entity7 to know that not only my family and i have been victims of these extortioners who are detained today . also hundreds of @entity7 families have been victims , and the greatest victim has been president @entity108 , for which these people deserve to be punished with the harshest penalties that exist , " he said , according to @entity42 . demonstrators outside the courthouse tuesday both advocated and denounced @entity10 , @entity0 affiliate @entity115 reported . some claimed he had taken over land in @entity7 without paying for it . but members of @entity7 's @entity121 community said @entity10 , an @entity122 from @entity2 , had been unjustly accused . some of them held signs in @entity125 . " he is one more jew who is the victim of persecution , " one man said . " we hope justice is done . we hope he is freed . being free , he can defend himself . we hope that all of his property which has been seized , practically robbed , is returned to him .
