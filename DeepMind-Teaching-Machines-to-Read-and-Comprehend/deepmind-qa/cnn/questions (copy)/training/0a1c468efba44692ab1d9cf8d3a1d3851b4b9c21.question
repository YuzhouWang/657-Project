( @entity0 ) -- the federal government shutdown is a virtually unprecedented move by a political minority committed to rolling back one of the most significant legislative achievements in recent @entity7 history . the @entity8 of 2010 was passed by two houses of @entity10 after 14 months of debate . opponents then challenged the law 's constitutionality and lost that battle in the @entity16 . less than five months later , @entity7 voters re-elected by a 5 million - vote majority margin a president who stood foursquare behind the @entity8 . in so doing , the electorate rejected a @entity22 presidential candidate who promised its repeal . apparently the democratic processes by which @entity7 make choices and govern themselves are not acceptable to extremists in the @entity27 who seek to halt government or have their way . they would have @entity7 see their actions as a patriotic and high - minded defense of liberty . as the shutdown loomed , several @entity22 congressmen and analysts took to the airwaves to trivialize the significance of the @entity27 vote . some cited previous episodes to suggest that closing the federal government is a normal byproduct of the @entity7 people having " a very deep disagreement about the future of our country .

' " each step , in fact , had been an effort to shatter what the democratic process had painstakingly achieved . such rhetorical sleights of hand should not obscure the very radical departure the closure of most of the federal government represents . some members of the @entity27 apparently believe their steadfast opposition to the @entity81 law justifies the use of coercive threats : to defund @entity7 government and harm the economy . in seeking to trump a lawful vote of both houses of @entity10 , a @entity16 ruling and a reaffirming national presidential election , they tread on extremist ground . their hubris is radical and nothing in modern @entity7 history provides a fair counterpart . to be sure , each major expansion of the @entity7 federal government 's role in ensuring @entity99 , access to health care , and equal civil rights has been accompanied by intense ideological and partisan conflicts . but when milestone laws have survived the gantlet of @entity10 , been
