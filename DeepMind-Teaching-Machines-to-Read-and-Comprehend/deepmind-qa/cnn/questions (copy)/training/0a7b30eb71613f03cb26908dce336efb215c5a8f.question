video propaganda showing the @entity1 and @entity2 being blown up . talk of hitting @entity4 bases in the @entity5 . the renunciation of a 60 - year - old armistice that has kept the tenuous peace on the @entity9 . it seems barely a day passes without another @entity14 threat , and coming after the december launch of a long - range rocket and a third nuclear test in february , the florid declarations from @entity11 have gotten the attention of the @entity4 and its allies . more : @entity14 touts its human rights credentials so why now , and how nervous should you be ? here are five things to consider . it 's an inside game ... numerous analysts on both sides of the @entity5 attribute the aggressive posture is part of an attempt by @entity14 's young leader @entity29 to consolidate his power in the reclusive communist state founded by his grandfather . " first and foremost , it 's for his domestic audience , " said @entity33 , founder of the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 . " because without the support of the military , he wo n't be around for much longer . and so he has to bolster his support with the brass . " that 's a tough sell for @entity14 , " where age matters , " he added . @entity33 is believed to be 29 . more : @entity29 's life @entity47 , director of the @entity49 - based @entity48 , says there 's also a debate going on inside the @entity14 leadership about the country 's future as a nuclear state . one side wants " to be a nuclear - armed state that is able to behave like the recognized , legal nuclear weapons states and play their game and turn the tables on them , " @entity47 said . " that is , in my view , what is going on in the test and the rocket firing , " he said . " the other policy current is associated with the @entity68 and the international faction of the @entity70 , which is to negotiate our way out of this mess . " a recent statement from the foreign ministry declared that @entity14 would not give up its nuclear " sacred sword " as long as the @entity4 remains hostile -- a conditional statement that signals @entity11 may be willing to give up the bomb under the right circumstances , @entity47 said . analysis : what 's @entity29 up to ? ... but the talk is bigger this time " they say a lot of these kind of things , so there 's a tendency to treat it as the kind of stream of crazy you get from @entity14 , " said @entity83 , @entity84 director at the @entity86 - based @entity85 . " but this is not normal . it is more vitriolic . " a recent statement by a top @entity14 general specifically talked of hitting @entity100 with a nuclear weapon in the event of war . " that 's a pretty direct threat , " @entity83 said . more : timeline of @entity14 's threats the @entity14 rhetoric ramped up after the february 12 nuclear test and the @entity110 sanctions that followed . meanwhile , @entity111 , director of @entity112 at @entity113 and former director for @entity116 affairs at the @entity117 , told @entity122 's " @entity121 " that @entity14 has carried out some sort of military provocation within 14 weeks of every @entity36 presidential inauguration since 1992 . @entity36 president @entity123 took office on february 25 , " so start the clock , " he said . " what is not normal is that the backdrop for this is about a year of very unpredictable behavior by a new leadership , and a sequence of provocations that is more concentrated over a period of time than we have seen in the last 20 years , " he said . " so in that context , although to the average listener these threats may seem like it 's just the @entity14 firing their mouths off again , for those of us that look at this more closely this is a little bit different -- and more concerning . " their nukes are n't useful ... yet most observers say @entity11 is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile . while its scientists managed to lob a small satellite into space in december , putting a working device atop a missile , launching it and hitting a target with it is vastly more complicated , @entity47 said . more : nuclear weapons : who has what but @entity83 , who also runs the @entity163 blog , said the @entity14 may have tried to " skip a step " with its early bomb tests and build one small enough to fit on a missile . that might explain why its first two were relatively unsuccessful . " i think it 's plausible to think that they have a warhead design in which they are confident that 's under 1,000 kilograms ( 2,200 pounds ) -- still not as small as you need to put on a missile and launch it to the @entity4 , but closer than they were a couple of years ago , " he said . and while @entity100 has n't come out and said it , @entity83 said the march 15 announcement that the @entity180 will deploy additional ground - based missile interceptors on the @entity183 may signal that the @entity14 have deployed a long - range missile they put on display at a parade in 2012 . @entity83 said the announcement was " mostly for show , " but could reflect real @entity4 concerns about those missiles . " if you 're going to spend $ 1 billion to deploy interceptors , they ought to come right out and say it , " he said . but nukes are n't everything @entity14 also has plenty of conventional military firepower , including medium - range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles , as well as thousands of cannons , rocket launchers and tanks massed across the @entity204 that separates @entity205 . @entity35 is within range of many of those weapons , and the @entity205 has threatened before to turn the southern capital into a " sea of fire . " a @entity14 bombardment could kill tens of thousands of people in @entity35 before @entity36 and @entity4 retaliation could smash those guns , @entity47 said . but that would essentially launch a new @entity217 -- one he said would end badly for the long - impoverished @entity205 . " they have less than 30 days of fuel and no ability to refuel , " he said . " they 've got to fight a very short war before they 're just walking to where they 're going to fight . " @entity11 keeps its forces massed on the @entity227 " precisely because they 're weak , " he said . there are other avenues . when computers at @entity36 banks and broadcasters began to crash on wednesday , suspicion initially fell on the @entity205 . @entity36 has accused the @entity205 of similar hacking attacks before , including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations . @entity238 , a cybersecurity expert with the @entity239 , said the hacking is consistent with previous @entity14 actions . threats of annihilation normal for @entity36 so now what ? for years , @entity11 has made deals to curtail its nuclear and missile work in exchange for economic aid . those deals have fallen apart when the @entity251 went on to conduct other tests . the six - party talks among the @entity205 , its @entity116 neighbors and the @entity4 fizzled in 2007 , and the @entity205 's first attempt at a satellite launch scotched a previous @entity4 plan to trade hundreds of thousands of tons of food for a halt to weapons work . " i think the problem right now is that you can not engage them directly after they have done a series of ballistic missile and nuclear tests , and we are going into a period of sanctions now through the @entity
