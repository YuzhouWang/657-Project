the @entity1 government is fuming over the release of the " @entity3 , " claiming president @entity4 forced the film into theaters and onto streaming video services . " @entity11 president @entity4 is the chief culprit who forced the @entity14 to ' indiscriminately distribute ' the movie and took the lead in appeasing and blackmailing cinema houses and theatres in the @entity11 mainland to distribute the movie , " @entity1 's @entity8 said saturday , according to state - run media . " @entity4 always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest . " in the screwball comedy , a tabloid journalist who is granted an interview with @entity1 ruler @entity27 is asked to assassinate him . but when he arrives , the movie version of the dictator charms him . later on , however , the two wage battle . ' inescapable deadly blows ' just getting " @entity3 " into theaters and online streams has been an ordeal . @entity14 had initially suspended the @entity37 release of the movie after its it systems were hacked by a group called the " @entity41 , " which had complained about the movie 's pending release . the group also warned of severe attacks on movie theaters showing the film . in the cyberattack , thieves took a possible record haul of 100 terabytes of data -- a slew of movies and other content , company secrets , personal information of employees and the social security numbers of celebrities . the @entity60 has blamed @entity1 for that cyberattack . @entity1 , in turn , slammed the @entity11 for the accusation . " if the @entity11 is to persistently insist that the hacking attack was made by the @entity1 , the @entity11 should produce evidence without fail , though belatedly , " said the @entity66 statement carried saturday by the state - run @entity67 . " if the @entity11 persists in @entity11 - style arrogant , high - handed and gangster - like arbitrary practices despite the repeated warnings of the @entity1 , the @entity11 should bear in mind that its failed political affairs will face inescapable deadly blows . " @entity11 accused over @entity1 outage @entity75 's statement also accused the @entity11 of being behind the crippling outage of @entity1 's @entity77 last week . " the @entity11 , a big country , started disturbing the internet operation of major media of the @entity1 , " it said . the @entity11 government last week declined to say whether it was responsible for the internet disruption in @entity1 . @entity4 had earlier warned the @entity11 would " respond proportionally " to the @entity14 hack . @entity4 had also expressed disappointment at the movie 's suspension , saying free speech had been stifled . " we can not have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the @entity11 because if somebody is able to intimidate us out of releasing a satirical movie , imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they do n't like or news reports that they do n't like , " @entity4 said last week . " that 's not who we are . that 's not what @entity11 is about . " who 's behind the @entity14 cyberattack the @entity60 has said that the code of the malware used in the attack on @entity14 is similar to what @entity1 has used in other attacks . but that code was leaked a long time ago , cyberexperts say , and any hacker around the world could have used it . some @entity11 cyberexperts say the evidence the @entity60 has presented is n't enough to isolate @entity1 as the culprit . " it 's clear to us , based on both forensic and other evidence we 've collected , that unequivocally
