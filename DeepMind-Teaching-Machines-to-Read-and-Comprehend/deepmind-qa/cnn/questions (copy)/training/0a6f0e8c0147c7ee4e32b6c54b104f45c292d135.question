( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 and @entity3 knew each other online -- she 's read his blog , he 's seen her tweets -- before they met in person in @entity8 a few weeks ago . a bit awkward , they made small talk , spending an hour or so getting to know each other . " when i 'm with someone new , my primary bit of nervousness is i have no idea if they 'll like me , or be attracted to me , or be interested in me , " @entity2 says . " it 's sort of akin to a first date situation . " but this was n't a first date -- it was strictly business . after chatting , @entity2 and @entity3 got to work , which in their case meant having sex . @entity2 and @entity3 ( their stage names ) are adult performers . while hooking up with a new co-star can provoke some anxiety , there 's one thing they 're usually not anxious about : getting a sexually transmitted disease from their co-star , since both get tested for @entity39 at least once a month . " before you start shooting , you go online to see the other person 's test results , " @entity3 explains . " or sometimes on set , before you start , they show you the results on paper . " such diligence about @entity39 is a good idea for anyone having sex with a new partner , even if you 're not a porn star , says dr. @entity53 , director of clinical research at the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 . " it really shows they 're thinking conscientiously , " @entity53 says . " i think it really works . " @entity61 , which does @entity39 screenings for adult performers , routinely tests for @entity64 , chlamydia , and gonorrhea , according to @entity67 , president and ceo of the service . in addition , some performers opt for an additional panel of tests for hepatitis b , hepatitis c and syphilis . so far , @entity2 and @entity3 say it 's worked for them . @entity2 says in her eight years as an adult performer -- she has about five sexual partners a month professionally -- she has n't contracted a single std. she says when she has sex with men outside work she always uses a condom . @entity3 says about once a year he comes down with a case of chlamydia or gonorrhea . " i take some pills and it goes away in a week , " he says , adding that outside of work he has sex only with other performers , since he 's knows they 're regularly tested . while the testing is n't foolproof , it lowers the risk of getting infected . combine that with condom use and the risk goes down even more . @entity64 is a particularly tricky test , since it may provide a false negative if taken too soon after a person is exposed to @entity64 . this is because most people do n't produce enough antibodies for the test to detect until around a month after being exposed . some people take three months or longer to produce detectable antibodies . " i think about this all the time , " says @entity2 , who 's been an adult performer for eight years . " it 's by far the biggest risk in the industry . i think the one thing that gives me comfort -- small comfort -- is that the people i 'm working with by and large have very strong safer sex practices because of what they do for a living . " @entity3 says he 's not too concerned about contracting @entity64 since he has sex only with women , but he adds that he knows he 's taking at least a small risk . " there 's risk in a lot of jobs , " he says . " professional athletes take risks . " when beginning a new relationship , many wonder what diseases they should get tested for . " it 's a very common question , for both males and females , " @entity53 says . neither the @en
