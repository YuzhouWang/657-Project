( @entity0 ) -- it all started out quite innocently , with jokes about the @entity3 's perma - frown and @entity5 collections of weird , what - the - @entity7 moments from the opening ceremony . from there , however , the @entity11 conversation about the @entity12 has taken a rapid turn toward the troll - ish . athletes have been flaming sports announcers and lobbing racist comments at people from other countries . pretty much everyone on the @entity22 has contributed to the # @entity24 hashtag . a spectator told a @entity27 diver that his fourth - place finish " let your dad down . " ( a dad , by the way , who died of cancer last year . ) and @entity11 itself has come under fire for briefly deleting the account of one of the @entity39 ' and @entity40 's biggest critics , purportedly for breaking the site 's terms or use . was n't this supposed to be the " @entity44 , " where everyone rejoiced in the digital - era magic of hearing directly from the world 's best athletes and scrolling through a global , real - time conversation about what must be the planet 's most " @entity52 " - like sporting event ? it was . the @entity55 even promoted it as such . but maybe that was the wrong expectation for a communications platform that has become much more than a feel - good public relations tool . as @entity60 wrote on monday for @entity61 , @entity11 has also helped fuel dictator - toppling protest movements . " it 's almost as if the @entity55 is completely unaware of the role @entity11 and @entity66 played in the @entity67 , " he wrote , " or the frequency with which people use it to communicate in real time . " in terms of numbers , the @entity39 certainly have been the @entity44 , far outpacing both the @entity74 and @entity75 , when @entity11 was n't quite the global communications phenom it has become in 2012 . " there were more tweets in a single day last week than during the entire 2008 @entity82 , " @entity11 wrote in a blog post on its @entity27 site , adding that more than 60 % of @entity27 athletes are on @entity11 . " we 've already seen 10 million mentions of the term olympics during the @entity39 as fans use @entity11 to get to the heart of the action , " the company said . ( enough of that traffic came from @entity89 , by the way , that the @entity92 committee reportedly asked spectators to refrain from tweeting and texting unless it 's " urgent , " in an effort to lessen the network 's load . ) over the years , @entity11 , which did not respond to a request for comment on this story , has become the @entity12 ' " cocktail hour , " where both athletes and couch dwellers chatter about the games , said @entity105 , spokesman for @entity106 , a social media tracker . in 2010 , he said , more than 307,000 tweets contained the term " @entity12 " on the first weekend of the @entity110 in @entity111 . this year , that number jumped tenfold , to more than 3.5 million tweets on the opening weekend of the @entity39 in @entity89 . " two or four years ago it was n't as common . four years ago , especially , it was really just people in their houses saying ' oh my gosh did you see that dive . ' it was people talking to their social circles , " he said . " as twitter as a platform has evolved and behavior has evolved , it is happening on both ends . now there are way more athletes who are on . and there are way more people who are sharing their viewing habits , on @entity11 especially . " 12 great @entity12 - related @entity11 accounts what those athletes say , however , can be another matter . a @entity141 athlete was expelled from the @entity39 after he called @entity143 athletes " mongoloids , " according to @entity144 ; and a @entity147 triple - jumper was banned for writing on @entity11 that " with so many @entity150 in @entity147 , the mosquitoes from the @entity149 will at least be eating some homemade food . " more benign , but still unexpected , was @entity152 , an @entity153 soccer star , who used her @entity11 feed to blast player - turned - analyst @entity155 , telling @entity40 to employ a soccer commentator who " knows more about the game . " and several prominent olympians have taken to @entity11 in protest of @entity161 . that rule bans the athletes from using their social media accounts to promote companies other than the official @entity92 sponsors . " i am honored to be an @entity168 , but # @entity170 # @entity169 " several of the athletes posted . opinion : should we trust @entity11 ? that kind of political dissent is new , said @entity176 , a senior projects editor at @entity61 who is covering the @entity39 . " athletes are taking to @entity11 to voice frustrations with the way that the sports system is currently constructed and oriented , " he said by phone from @entity89 . " that 's something we really have n't seen before -- or not in such a coordinated way , having a couple dozen really prominent @entity168 starting to really talk about those issues . beyond that i think it 's just so much more part of how these athletes interact with the world than ever before , certainly . we saw some people tweeting at @entity74 and a few more at @entity111 -- and now it 's just part of the oxygen . " the @entity39 , however , have been testing the limits of how far @entity11 , @entity40 and law enforcement will let the spitfire of real - time conversation go . @entity27 police reportedly arrested a 17 - year - old " on suspicion of malicious communications " after he sent a @entity11 message to @entity27 diver @entity201 telling the diver he had disappointed his recently deceased father by placing fourth in monday 's synchronized diving competition on the 10 - meter platform . the @entity207 erupted monday and tuesday after @entity11 temporarily suspended the account of @entity209 , a journalist who had been one of
