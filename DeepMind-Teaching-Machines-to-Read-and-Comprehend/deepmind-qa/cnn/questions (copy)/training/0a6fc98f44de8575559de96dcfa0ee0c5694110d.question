@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- at least 48 people were killed and scores were wounded tuesday when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives - laden vest in central @entity0 as men were queuing up outside an @entity1 army recruitment center , the @entity3 said . at least 129 people were wounded in the blast , which took place in the morning in the @entity15 commercial area . the spokesman for the @entity1 military command in the capital , maj. gen. @entity16 , said prime minister @entity19 ordered a number of officers who were near the attacker to be detained for questioning . @entity16 told @entity25 state television that tuesday had been the final day of a weeklong recruitment drive and that a large number of recruits had been waiting to sign up when the attack occurred . @entity16 said the bomber 's vest was stuffed with 30 kilograms ( 66 pounds ) of the plastic explosive @entity32 , @entity33 and ball bearings . the attack came amid the country 's failure to form a government and the @entity39 ' troop drawdown ahead of president @entity41 's august 31 deadline for ending all combat operations . the @entity43 , or @entity43 , condemned the act and expressed concern over continued acts of violence in the country , " including those perpetrated during the holy @entity50 month of @entity51 that symbolizes the values of peace , tolerance , generosity and solidarity . " " @entity43 reiterates that agreement on the formation of the government will greatly contribute to strengthening @entity1 's ability to protect its citizens and respond effectively to those who aim at perpetuating instability and insecurity in the country and reversing its path towards peace and prosperity . " the @entity1 government has been pushing to increase security ahead of the drawdown , which would leave a residual @entity39 force of 50,000 troops focused on stability operations as well as advising and assisting @entity1 security forces . recruitment centers for @entity1 security forces have frequently been targeted by suicide bombers . a recent campaign of bombings and shootings has targeted @entity1 forces , especially in the capital , where gunmen have attacked traffic police and attacked checkpoints , killing @entity1 troops . many @entity1 have blamed the recent wave of violence on the current political paralysis , in which quarreling parties have failed to form a government nearly six months after parliamentary elections . the attack has increased concerns among @entity1 about the ability of security forces to protect them when they can not protect a government office . an @entity3 official said two roadside bombs detonated last week outside the same center , wounding three people . extremist groups , such as @entity105 in @entity1 , are known to take advantage of political fissures to carry out more attacks to create further turmoil . a spate of other incidents occurred tuesday , said an @entity3 official , who cited : -- a generator caught fire in eastern @entity0 that killed two people and injured 25 others . -- a string of drive - by shootings and bombings in @entity0 and @entity120 that killed three people and wounded five . -- a roadside bomb in the capital that seriously wounded the judge who heads @entity0 's appeals . -- a car bomb that detonated in the town of @entity128 northeast of the capital , killing two other judges . -- a drive - by shooting in western @entity0 's @entity133 neighborhood that killed a senior @entity135 official . -- a drive - by shooting in eastern @entity0 that wounded three occupants of a car . -- a hand grenade thrown at a police patrol in western @entity0 that wounded a policeman and a civilian . the website iraqbodycount.org estimated that nearly 2,000 @entity1 civilians had been killed this year through june . " we continue to bleed as a nation , " @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity39 , @entity145 , told @entity146 . he called the attacks " despicable , " but said , " we do not believe there is any chance that they will derail the political process or destabilize the country . people are fed up with them and i do n't believe they will achieve any political purpose . " in @entity159 , deputy white house press secretary @entity158 said president @entity41 condemned the attacks . " there are obviously still people who want to derail the advances that the @entity1 people have made towards democracy , but they are firmly on track and we 're confident that we 're moving towards the end of our combat mission there , " he said . the political crisis worsened on monday when former @entity1 prime minister @entity172 's @entity25 party announced that it was suspending talks with @entity19 's coalition in response to comments he made in a television interview . @entity179 , a spokeswoman for @entity25 , told @entity2 the group decided to suspend negotiations after @entity19 described @entity172 's candidate list as a " sunni list " in an interview aired monday by the @entity39 - funded n
