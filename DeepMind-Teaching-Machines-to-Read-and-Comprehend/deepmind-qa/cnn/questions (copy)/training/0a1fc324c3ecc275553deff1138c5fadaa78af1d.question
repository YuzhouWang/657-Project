( @entity0 ) -- the @entity4 administration calculates it 's likely @entity6 may test fire mobile ballistic missiles at any time , based on the most recent intelligence showing @entity9 probably has completed launch preparations , a @entity2 official said tuesday . the administration believes a test launch could happen without @entity6 issuing a standard notice to commercial aviation and maritime shipping warning them to stay away from the missile 's path , according to the official , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the information . he cautioned most of the information comes from satellite imagery , so it 's impossible to reach a definitive conclusion because the @entity2 has no means to gather information on the ground . " we hope they issue a notification , but at this point we do n't expect it . we are working on the assumption they wo n't , " the official said . he said the launch could be " imminent , " but also cautioned that the @entity2 " simply does n't know . " the official , along with a @entity39 official , said that the @entity2 has been able to keep satellites over the suspected launch area for most of the past week . the @entity2 thinks the missiles remain at a point about halfway down the eastern coast of @entity6 and are about 10 miles inland . imagery has been impeded by some bad weather , which means there is less than perfect knowledge about what is happening on the ground . but based on what the @entity2 has seen , the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch . after any launch , @entity2 satellites and radars in the region would be able to calculate the trajectory of missiles within minutes and quickly conclude whether they are on a test path headed for open ocean or potentially headed for land areas such as @entity67 . the @entity2 and @entity67 would then have to decide whether to try to shoot the missiles down , the officials said .

" " a major conflict in @entity6 could have unpredictable , long term and far reaching impacts due to the central location of the @entity92 in @entity93 and the vital importance of @entity96 trade to the global economy , " said adm. @entity86 , commander of the @entity87 . the admiral spoke at a @entity100 hearing and submitted testimony to the committee . he said he 's confident that the @entity2 would be able to help defend @entity2 forces and its friends . he acknowledged the importance of @entity107 's role in reducing tensions on the @entity92 . the hearing came as @entity6 issued its latest dispatch of ominous rhetoric tuesday , telling foreigners in @entity113 they should take steps to protect themselves in the event of a conflict . " @entity119 's stated emphasis on economic development and promises of economic growth have so far yielded little , and are under
