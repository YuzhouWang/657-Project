@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- it 's one of the busiest days in this year 's primary calendar . six states from coast to coast hold primaries on tuesday , and again anti-establishment candidates face long odds in high - profile @entity10 showdowns . since its birth in 2009 , the tea party has had a number of primary successes , with victorious challenges from the right producing major headlines for the movement . but they 've also given the party plenty of headaches and hurt its chances of winning back the @entity24 , effectively costing the @entity10 five winnable elections over the last two cycles . this year , the establishment learned to fight back , and so far has had the upper hand in most contests against tea party - backed challengers . here are five key showdowns to watch how they play out on tuesday . 1 . big showdown in the @entity34 : tuesday 's marquee battle is in @entity34 , where @entity24 gop leader @entity36 is challenged by businessman @entity37 , who enjoys strong support from many tea party groups and influential conservative anti-establishment organizations . while this race has seen big spending by the campaigns and outside groups , @entity41 is expected to cruise to renomination for a sixth term . anti-establishment republicans feel @entity41 represents everything wrong in @entity0 and thought he could be knocked off . the @entity52 fund , a @entity0 - based anti-establishment organization , spent around $ 1 million in support of @entity37 and against @entity41 . but it 's been quiet recently , with @entity41 's formidable lead in the polls . @entity41 had two @entity34 - based super pacs supporting him as well as the @entity61 @entity60 and the @entity62 . " it was a vintage @entity36 campaign . they found @entity37 's weaknesses and used them against him . they boxed him in and he could n't move , " said @entity66 , senior editor for the non-partisan @entity67 , a top campaign handicapper . she added that " @entity37 suffered from new candidate syndrome . " @entity41 's ending his primary campaign by once again touting his endorsement from @entity34 's other @entity10 senator , @entity73 . @entity73 was the upstart who beat @entity41 's pick in the race . but @entity73 , who is very influential among tea party activists and libertarians , backed @entity41 last year before @entity37 got into the race . the narrator in one of @entity41 's two closing statewide tv commercials says , " on tuesday , join with @entity73 and vote for @entity36 . " and the spot includes a clip of @entity73 saying last year that @entity34 " ought to be proud of having senator @entity41 . " while @entity41 should have an early night on tuesday , he faces a serious challenge in november from rising @entity88 star @entity87 . big - name democrats are already campaigning for her . 2 . @entity90 -- the other big event : the other high - profile , outsider vs. establishment battle of the night is in the @entity95 . eight - term rep. @entity96 faces a serious primary challenge from @entity98 , an attorney who claims that @entity99 's not conservative enough and is soft on spending . @entity98 is backed by some tea party groups and by the @entity0 - based anti-tax group @entity102 , which has a history of backing conservative primary challengers . the group has spent some $ 700,000 to attack @entity99 and support @entity98 . but their spending dwindled the past couple of weeks , as @entity99 has held a sizable lead in recent polls . @entity99 is backed by the @entity61 @entity60 , which has spent heavily in the race . " you can take it from me , the conservative choice for @entity115 is @entity96 , " @entity111 says in one ad put out by the chamber last month . @entity99 , was an early backer of the @entity10 2012 presidential nominee 's campaign . and @entity111 returned the favor last year , endorsing @entity99 . the winner of the primary will be the odds - on - favorite in november in the heavily @entity10 district , which covers the central and eastern parts of the state , from @entity129 to the borders with @entity131 and @entity132 . 3 . @entity133 -- tea party splits vote : @entity10 sen. @entity137 ' announcement last year that he would n't run for re-election triggered a free - for - all @entity10 primary battle . reps . @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , former @entity133 secretary of state @entity144 , and businessman @entity145 are the major candidates and
