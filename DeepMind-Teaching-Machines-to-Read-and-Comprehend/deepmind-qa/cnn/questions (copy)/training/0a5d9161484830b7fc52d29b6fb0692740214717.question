editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a bestselling author whose forthcoming book is " @entity5 : a @entity6 . " @entity2 says @entity7 demonstrate an extraordinary devotion to duty . ( @entity3 ) -- there is a beach in @entity12 , @entity13 , just across the bridge from @entity15 . it offers a beautiful view of the @entity18 , which is why it attracts tourists who are drawn to the sun. i thought about that beach yesterday , when the news from the @entity24 near the @entity25 was flashed around the world -- the news that the captain of the cargo ship @entity30 had been rescued from @entity32 pirates by @entity34 forces operating off the @entity35 . that beach in @entity13 seems quite placid , even sedate . the historic , red - gabled @entity12 sits upon it -- the place where the @entity43 - @entity42 - @entity41 movie " @entity44 " was filmed . the feeling of the place is one of genteel manners , of delicate tradition . you almost expect to see guests carrying parasols and making reservations to play croquet . but down the beach there is another kind of tradition . that 's what i was thinking about on sunday . when i have stayed on @entity12 , i walk down that beach toward the @entity62 . i remember a makeshift fence separating the beach from the far reaches of the base . but it was easy to walk around , and no one appeared to take it especially seriously . i have n't been back since september 11 , 2001 ; i would be very surprised if the barriers are n't more formidable now . on that part of the beach , on the outskirts of @entity72 , i saw @entity7 in training . here , the @entity76 winnows the men who would be seals from the ones who fall short . it was a humbling thing to witness . as the @entity76 itself puts it , seal training is like few other competitions : " @entity77 go through what is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training in the world . ... the most important trait that distinguishes @entity7 from all other military forces is that seals are @entity92 , as they strike from and return to the sea . @entity7 ( @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 ) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate . their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces can not approach undetected . " they looked so young , those prospective seals on @entity12 beach . the maximum age to apply to be a seal is 28 . they all know what they 're getting into when they sign up , but to see their faces -- including the faces of the ones who were falling behind , who probably were n't going to make the cut , who were gasping for air on the arduous runs along the beach and having trouble during the maneuvers in the ocean -- was to see a devotion to the concept of duty on a level few of the rest of us will ever know . maybe you , during the recent days when capt. @entity134 was held captive on that lifeboat off the coast of @entity137 , were asking yourself who in the world could come to his rescue . who had the training , and the courage , to carry out such a mission . we probably do n't ask ourselves that kind of question often enough . usually , military operations are talked about in the abstract , as if they 're lines on a chalkboard , or brightly glowing diagrams on a computer screen . but once in a while , like now , we stop to focus on what we ask of the people who serve in our stead when the task seems all but impossible . @entity159 would sometimes quote a line that summed up our wonder at those who make the choice to serve our country in this way : " where do we find such men ? " we find them among us , although we usually do n't know it when we see it . on @entity12 , on @entity171 , there was a bar called @entity173 's , owned by an ex-seal named @entity175 . whenever i would stop in there , groups of guys from the naval base would be having a cheeseburger , maybe listening to a local acoustic band play a guitars - only version of @entity185 ' " @entity186 . " you 'd sit among them , and it was easy to forget what brought them to this strip of sand . it was n't for vacation , or relaxation . where do we find such men ? sometimes at the next table over , listening to the music . from the @entity7 ' creed : " my loyalty to country and team is beyond reproach . i humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow @entity34 , always ready to defend those who are unab
