@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 is ready when a fellow student says " no thanks " to early voting because of the thrill of casting a ballot on @entity8 . " things come up , you can have an exam , " says @entity3 , the president of the @entity9 . " you can wait until @entity8 and not know where your precinct is . a lot of students have to go to elementary schools around town , and they do n't have cars , they do n't really know where it is . " truth is , @entity3 knows younger voters like herself are less reliable when it comes to turning out in the crunch , and " with early voting , it just gives us 40 more chances to catch people . " @entity3 led by example thursday , waiting in line for more than an hour to cast her ballot on the first day of in - person early voting in @entity1 . the line at the @entity36 was dominated by @entity38 voters , as was a @entity40 polling place @entity2 visited as the doors opened thursday . @entity3 says the @entity38 campaign and state @entity43 have urged her to keep checking her list and pushing students to vote now . " if you vote early , it frees up campaign resources to talk to people who might be undecided , " she told us as she waited patiently to vote . @entity1 is one of 35 states plus the @entity54 that allow some form of early in - person voting . of the nine presidential battlegrounds @entity2 now rates as tossups , only @entity56 and @entity57 do not have large - scale early voting . in voting , the early bird skips the line in @entity1 four years ago , early voting accounted for 36 % of the ballots cast for president . in @entity68 , home of the @entity9 , it was 55 % , the highest of @entity1 's 99 counties , and county auditor @entity70 says demand for early ballots so far is up significantly from 2008 . key states voting early and @entity43 have a big early edge . in @entity68 , requests for mail - in ballots as of monday were running more than 12 - 1 in favor of @entity43 . @entity82 , as of close of business wednesday , the @entity1 secretary of state 's office said @entity43 had a nearly 5 - 1 edge in making requests for absentee ballots . republicans here do n't dispute the early @entity43 advantage in ballot requests . but they promise to narrow the edge somewhat ; the @entity92 's first mailing nudging republicans to consider mail - in voting was sent just this week . @entity1 @entity86 also suggest too much can be made of the early numbers , making the case that those voting before the presidential debates are hardcore partisans who were almost certain to vote eventually anyway . " if you look at who is early - voting right now , absentee ballots , 80 % , almost 90 % , are ' four of four ' voters , meaning they voted in the last four elections , " veteran @entity1 @entity92 strategist @entity100 told @entity2 . " so it 's a difference of strategy . you put your money into the last three weeks or you put your money into early voting . the @entity86 will put a little more into the last three weeks , and the @entity43 a little more into the first initial blast of early voting . " @entity100 said one effort in which @entity43 were smart to focus so much early voting attention was younger voters . " four years ago there was a lot of enthusiasm among younger voters and everybody knows that has lessened , " @entity100 said . " they have got to figure out the strategy to increase their early voting . " polls : @entity38 leads in @entity56 , tight race in @entity127 , @entity128 on the flip side , he said @entity86 @entity130 runs stronger among the state 's elderly voters , who are among the most reliable to cast ballots . more broadly , @entity100 conceded a modest @entity38 edge in @entity1 at the moment and said there is nervous talk among some @entity86 that @entity130 could hurt @entity92 candidates in competitive congressional and other races . in his view , suc
