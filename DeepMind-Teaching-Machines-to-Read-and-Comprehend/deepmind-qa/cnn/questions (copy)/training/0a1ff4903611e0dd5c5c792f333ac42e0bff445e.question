@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the overflowing @entity3 dealt anguish to its namesake state thursday , reaching a historic height at @entity0 , sending backwater up the @entity8 , which has swallowed a home owned by the governor , and claiming the life of a 69 - year - old man . as the flood 's trail of destruction worked its way south , @entity0 saw the river crest at the expected peak of 57.1 feet early thursday , hours ahead of the original forecast . the @entity20 predicts the crest will hold through at least saturday morning . " residents who live along the river need to keep an eye out and be vigilant , " said @entity22 , a senior hydrologist with the weather service 's @entity1 , office . " we 're not going to fall to the kind of levels we got to during the large 2008 flood until early june , and wo n't fall below flood stage until mid-to - late june . " @entity33 sheriff @entity32 said the county , which includes @entity0 , has " several hundred homes that have water . " about 2,000 residents have been displaced , including nearly 1,000 who were evacuated from @entity39 10 days ago . so far , a critical levee near the lake is holding . many @entity33 residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do , but none have experienced it at this magnitude , @entity32 added thursday . also of concern is a traffic " nightmare " on the principal north - south highway , said @entity32 . " we 've never seen water that has closed @entity54 61 , " he said . @entity0 motorists can not take @entity54 61 to reach @entity56 to the north or @entity58 to the south because of flooded roadway . instead , commuters are using two - lane roads that were n't designed for the volume , the sheriff told @entity2 . the river began cresting ahead of schedule wednesday night , probably because an old levee system in @entity68 , @entity1 , was breached last friday and spread the flood 's flow , @entity22 said . the @entity1 is more than 14 feet above flood stage at @entity0 and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927 . water levels in @entity76 , a city about 70 miles south , are already nearly 4 feet beyond the record , with the river at 61.9 feet thursday night -- and the crest is n't expected to arrive until saturday . a @entity0 resident , @entity79 , died after being pulled from floodwater in @entity33 , @entity1 , the county coroner said thursday . it is the first reported death linked to the flooding in the state . emergency workers with the fire department pulled him from the water at 9:35 a.m. tuesday and took him to @entity89 , where @entity79 was put on life support , coroner @entity85 said . he died early thursday . officials do not know how @entity79 ended up in the floodwater , the coroner said . the @entity93 was keeping a watchful eye on the @entity95 , which residents near @entity0 were counting on for protection . it is designed to keep water from backing into parts of the @entity101 . the backwater levee was being " armored "
