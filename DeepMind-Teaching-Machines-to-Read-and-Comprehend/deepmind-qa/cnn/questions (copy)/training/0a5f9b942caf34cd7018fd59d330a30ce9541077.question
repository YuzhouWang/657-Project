" " those of us who work on both sides of @entity22 must now move forward with the important decisions that face us , particularly finding ways to soften the fallout from the economic downturn and balancing our budget as revenues decline , " he said in a statement . " we have a lot of work to do together to get @entity0 through these tough times .
