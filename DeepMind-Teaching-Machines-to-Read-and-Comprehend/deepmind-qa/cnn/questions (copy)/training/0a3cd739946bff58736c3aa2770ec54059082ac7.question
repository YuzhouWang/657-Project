" all war criminals must face justice , " @entity13 said . he refused to give more details about the operation but said @entity2 authorities continue to probe " who aided and @entity25 ... and those people will face justice . " @entity3 , now 69 , led @entity4 forces during the 1992 - 95 war that followed @entity31 's secession from @entity12 . the @entity32 for the former @entity12 has charged him with leading a genocidal campaign against @entity31 's @entity35 and @entity36 populations and with having " direct involvement " in the 1995 killings of nearly 8,000 men and boys in the @entity35 enclave of @entity42 . he was transferred from @entity15 , about 80 km ( 50 miles ) north of @entity18 , to courthouse in the capital for a preliminary hearing after his arrest , and the tribunal said it looked forward to his " expeditious transfer " to the @entity50 , @entity51 , for trial . once there , he will be allowed to enter a plea to the charges against him , which include genocide , crimes against humanity and violating the laws of war , according to a statement from the court .

" @entity3 is accused of leading a campaign of " ethnic cleansing , " widespread killing , forcible deportations , torture , forced labor and physical , psychological and sexual violence during the @entity31 war . but he remains a hero to some of his former soldiers , said @entity87 , a former @entity88 envoy to @entity12 , suggesting that his supporters had sheltered him in @entity2 . the international police agency @entity90 praised the arrest as " a triumph for international justice . " @entity90 officials had met with @entity13 in january to discuss closer cooperation in the hunt for war crimes suspects , the organization 's secretary - general , @entity94 , said in a statement on @entity3 's capture . " after today 's arrest , no one should doubt @entity2 's commitment to the rule of law and justice , " @entity94 said . @entity13 said the arrest will help the process of reconciliation throughout the @entity110 and should pave the way for @entity2 's entry into the @entity88 . @entity113 , a senior research fellow at the @entity114 , called thursday " an incredibly important day for @entity2 .
