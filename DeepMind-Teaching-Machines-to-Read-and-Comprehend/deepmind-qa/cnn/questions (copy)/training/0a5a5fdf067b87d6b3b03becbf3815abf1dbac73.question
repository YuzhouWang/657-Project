( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 and @entity2 have always taken things to the extreme . @entity2 , left , and @entity1 will be spending only 12 hours in each city before going to their next stop . so when @entity9 announced a monthlong all - you - can - jet pass for $ 599 , it was as if the airline had practically issued them a challenge . " we decided to come up with the most extreme length you could take it and have the most fun without being crazy , " @entity2 told @entity0 .

" and for them , the price is unbeatable . the way they see it , if each flight cost $ 200 , they 're taking a $ 10,000 trip for only $ 600 . which is exactly why the promotion has received such a great deal of buzz , specifically among social networking platforms . @entity9 suspended the deal two days early , saying they were sold out , though the company declined to specify how many people bought them . @entity91 , who is taking time off from freelance work to take advantage , grabbed a pass right away . she decided that with the buzz on @entity96 , she could start organizing a group of fellow all - you - can - jet travelers , calling it the 599club . she created a site where people are sharing their itineraries in an attempt to either trave
