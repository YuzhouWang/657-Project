( @entity0 ) -- corrections officers looking inside @entity3 's cell found him with a sheet tied around his neck , his knees bent , his shorts around his ankles , 27 minutes after their last look . they also found that the convicted kidnapper had apparently done more than kill himself that day , according to a report on @entity3 's death from the @entity15 . he wrote a note -- dated that same day , september 3 -- invoking scripture and saying that those who confessed with their heart " will be saved . " " @entity21 loves you , " @entity3 wrote in all capital letters , " for all are sinners , we all fall short of the glory of @entity21 . @entity27 is my saviour and yours ! ! " did this constitute a suicide note ? that 's subject to interpretation ; the only person who would know it , @entity3 , is n't alive to answer . but the report released wednesday indicates that he did indeed kill himself . in the process , it also refuted a theory he died accidentally while engaged in auto - erotic asphyxiation , with state patrol spokeswoman lt. @entity40 saying no evidence was found to support this claim . one fact that some said pointed to this possibility was the fact that @entity3 was found with his pants pulled to his ankles and without underwear in his cell at the @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 . but , based partly on conversations with several inmates , the report found that @entity3 " frequently struggled to hold his pants up " after losing weight in prison . moreover , an official indicated that @entity3 " frequently did not wear underwear , " so the fact he did n't have any on at the time of his death was n't surprising . beyond that , the report also provides fresh detail into the final day of @entity3 , who just five months earlier was holding three women -- as well as one of their young daughters , whom he 'd fathered while in captivity -- in his @entity72 home . the document details nine times , between 2:14 p.m. and when his hanging body was found at 9:18 p.m. , that corrections officers had looked into his cell or went near or past it . he got a tray of food at 5:29 p.m. , for instance , and a " supervisor , an officer and a nurse ( stood ) in front of " @entity3 's cell one hour and 10 minutes later , according to surveillance video . the next time anyone went by was 8:51 p.m. , when the report indicated " an officer looked into @entity91 's cell . " " during the entirety of the video , no one is observed entering or exiting inmate @entity3 's cell prior to the emergency call by the officers , " the report notes . it added that " possible inaccurate and / or questionable entries " on the log book detailing what inmates were visited , and when , were found , but " no discrepancies were directly related to the death of @entity91 . " this comes after a report released in october found that two prison guards responsible for checking on @entity3 " did not
