this worn - down , one stoplight town found redemption friday night in a baptist church named @entity3 . cheers broke out in the pews as two @entity7 lawmakers abandoned their quest to strip @entity9 of its cityhood . the battle for the 89 - year - old city 's survival began in february with the release of a scathing audit that read like a textbook of municipal malfeasance -- finding 31 violations of local , state and federal codes , along with allegations of nepotism , double - dipping and personal use of city property . @entity26 was a sweet win for this city of just 477 residents -- 476 if you do n't count the former mayor , who 's sitting up the road in jail on a drug charge . already a notorious speed trap , the place gained even more infamy as a symbol of small - town corruption when the legislators threatened last month to yank its city charter . late - night comedians mocked @entity9 as " too @entity7 , even for @entity7 . " but even as @entity43 and the rest of world cackled , even as investigators carted boxes of documents out of @entity49 , even as some residents pointed fingers , others rolled up their sleeves and started to turn their city around . in just four short weeks , they came up with a plan that convinced state rep. @entity56 and sen. @entity57 to spare their city . they won an uphill fight nobody thought they could win . " thank you for the work that has been done , " @entity57 told the crowd of 50 gathered friday at @entity63 . " you 've got a lot more to do , but boy . ... " he clearly was impressed , and so was @entity69 , who said , " you 've done yeoman 's work . i think you 've done well . " the trouble began innocently enough , said @entity73 , @entity9 's newly appointed city attorney . a @entity75 station out on nearby @entity76 301 asked for police protection after a few bad traffic accidents and a couple of homicides . and so , @entity9 agreed to annex a 1,200 - foot stretch of highway . only later did someone come up with the idea that there was plenty of easy money to be made from catching speeders and writing tickets , just like neighboring cities @entity91 and @entity92 were doing . the scandal that set tongues wagging the way the city map was redrawn , it looked like a giant mosquito , with @entity9 sucking money directly from the highway . @entity100 was , the police department constantly overspent its budget , and all that ticket revenue never seemed to benefit anybody outside of @entity49 . the police department swelled to 19 officers , including the chief . but @entity109 county sheriff @entity109 said many of the officers were n't trained properly , and the audit found that some of them drove uninsured vehicles . one officer , nicknamed " @entity117 , " dressed in tactical gear and strapped an assault rifle across his chest -- just to write tickets . 2011 was @entity9 's bumper year for tickets -- and it was the year @entity69 was caught by @entity9 's radar guns . the lawmaker promptly paid his ticket , but the experience reminded him of the growing stack of citizen complaints . in april 2013 , @entity69 asked the state auditor general to look into the city 's finances . mayor @entity133 was sitting in the @entity134 in february when the audit was formally released . he and other city officials suspected it would be bad . but nobody had any idea how bad . read the audit ( @entity141 ) how bad was it ? so bad that legislators @entity57 and @entity69 immediately called for @entity9 's demise . in addition to the code violations , the audit found plenty of other eye - popping irregularities -- a $ 132,000 credit account at the local @entity153 station , for example , and $ 27,000 in credit card charges for items that " served no public purpose . " @entity69 accused @entity9 of " abusing the public , " while @entity57 wondered , " why is this even a city ? " when they met with @entity9 's citizens last month , the two men were taken aback by the passion of residents ' pleas to spare their city . some said yanking the charter would be like victimizing them twice . the lawmakers listened , and threw down a challenge : if the city did n't clean up its act soon , they vowed to move forward with a bill to dissolve the city 's charter -- an extreme measure , for sure . it would be the first time anyone could remember the @entity179 taking away a municipality 's right to govern itself . the legislators never expected @entity9 would meet the challenge . but @entity9 surprised them . four people -- call them @entity185 -- led the city 's charge . @entity188 became the acting mayor after @entity133 was arrested on a charge of selling a single 30 - milligram oxycodone pill to an undercover informant . @entity133 had n't been part of the problem ; he came into office as a reformer . but he did n't have time to be part of the solution , getting arrested less than two months after taking office . his replacement pleaded with the legislators to give @entity9 another chance and last month handed up a petition with 119 signatures . she softened their outrage by asking for their help . the rev. @entity209 was appointed to the @entity210 when @entity211 resigned in the midst of the scandal . @entity209 ' family has lived in @entity9 since the 1920s , and his talents include inspiring oratory and organizing armies of multiskilled volunteers . @entity220 stepped in as city clerk ; she knows @entity9 , having worked as the clerk once before . @entity223 understands how to use accounting software and knows how to apply for grants and follow money trails . already , she has discovered that @entity9 is only $ 6,425 in the red this year -- a shortfall that can easily be corrected . @entity73 took over as the city attorney . not only does he know municipal law and how to connect the dots , he 's working for the city free of charge . the lawmakers were swayed by the progress @entity9 has made under the new leadership . in just four weeks , @entity9 : accepted the resignation of every elected official who was in office when the scandal broke and called for a special election in september to seat new ones ; agreed to get rid of its police force ; accounted for the $ 132,000 spent at the @entity153 station across from @entity49 ; accounted for the $ 27,000 credit card balance ; started tracking the city 's water meters ; drafted an ordinance de-annexing the section of @entity76 301 where the speed trap operated ; and began holding @entity210 meetings at regular hours and opening them to the public . " what you 've seen here in the past month is the rebirth of your town , " @entity69 told the residents as friday 's meeting came to a close . " i want to encourage everybody who has never served on the @entity210 to run for office . ... we want some new blood . we want to see a new genesis in @entity9 . make this thing work for you . " the lawmakers say they will return to @entity9 once more to follow up on the city 's progress . the next visit is planned for a friday night in september , after the new council is elected . this time , there are plans for a good , old - fashioned @entity279 barbecue .
