( @entity0 ) -- this year 's @entity2 issue of @entity4 magazine showcases a diverse group of actors and actresses -- which is generally making the @entity8 very happy . among the performers featured on the magazine 's march cover , an annual showcase for @entity2 's best and brightest , are six actors of color : @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 . all starred in notable movies in 2013 , and two -- @entity15 and @entity22 -- are up for @entity23 . they share the cover with some @entity2 royalty , including @entity27 and @entity28 . 2014 awards season : does diversity matter more than wins ? observers welcomed the wider palette .
