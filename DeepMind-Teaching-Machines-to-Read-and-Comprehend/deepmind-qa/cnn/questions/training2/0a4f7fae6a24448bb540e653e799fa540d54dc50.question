@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- rescue workers struggled to clear rubble and bodies wednesday from the streets of @entity1 's " flattened " capital , where a government official said the death toll from tuesday 's 7.0 - magnitude earthquake may exceed 100,000 . thousands of injured people waited for care outside badly damaged hospitals , while an unknown number remained trapped inside collapsed buildings . basic services like water and electricity were out , and @entity1 president @entity19 said his government needs help clearing streets so rescuers can reach some of the hardest - hit areas . " we need medicine . we need medical help in general , " @entity19 told @entity2 . " some of the hospitals , they collapsed . " people were digging though the rubble of leveled buildings with their hands wednesday , looking for survivors or bodies , @entity2 's @entity29 reported from @entity0 . other @entity2 correspondents in @entity0 and its suburbs reported whole blocks of collapsed buildings , with dozens of bodies piled in the streets . @entity42 : how you can help video images captured just moments after the temblor show dust - covered survivors rushing through the streets , yelling in terror . others trapped in buildings are seen punching out debris and bricks , and shouting for help and trying to squeeze themselves out through cracks in the structures . @entity0 " is flattened , " said @entity1 's consul general to the @entity58 , @entity59 , who said he believed more than 100,000 people were dead . but @entity19 said other estimates ranged from 30,000 to 50,000 . " it 's too early to give a number , " @entity19 said . hear the prime minister describe the situation the 7.0 - magnitude earthquake struck shortly before 5 p.m. tuesday , centered about 10 miles ( 15 kilometers ) southwest of @entity0 , the @entity67 reported . it could be felt strongly in eastern @entity70 , more than 200 miles away . the earthquake 's power matched that of several nuclear bombs , said @entity74 , a professor of geophysics in the @entity76 at @entity77 in @entity78 . he said the combination of its magnitude and geographical shallowness made it particularly dangerous . about 3 million people -- one - third of @entity1 's population -- were affected by the quake , the @entity84 said . about 10 million people most likely felt shaking from the earthquake , the @entity67 said . @entity90 : @entity29 outside @entity1 's @entity91 as night fell over the island wednesday , gunshots sounded off in @entity0 . screams and wails could be heard with each aftershock . some people who still had homes refused to go inside , fearing collapse . scores huddled together in parks and sidewalks , trying to get rest . though planes carrying aid began arriving wednesday , humanitarian groups struggled to get the supplies to victims due to the poor roads and debris . there was no clear system for clearing debris , removing bodies and treating the injured , officials and journalists reported . " simply getting through the streets to collect the dead bodies is seemingly an impossible task , " @entity2 's dr. @entity116 reported from the capital , where shooting could be heard in the background . " there 's hardly any heavy machinery to try and dig through the rubble -- people are doing it by hand . " the hospitals themselves -- the destination of those patients who might survive -- they 're nonexistent or have a terrible infrastructure , " @entity116 said . @entity1 native and " heroes " cast member @entity137 was searching for his elderly parents in @entity1 on wednesday . he said the @entity1 government is not up to addressing the overwhelming nature of the disaster .

" most countries are way behind on fulfilling it . ... if you can provide any emergency help , if you can give us helicopters or basic medical supplies -- we need that , " @entity156 said . the @entity187 military is working to get ground and air assessments of the damage , with @entity215 cutters , airplanes and choppers deploying to the scene , and @entity220 ships preparing to leave . are you there ? submit an @entity222 two @entity215 crews of @entity225 fixed - wing aircraft were evacuating nearly 140 @entity187 personnel to @entity227 , @entity228 . @entity229 critically injured peopled were taken to the @entity230 , @entity70 . numerous relief organizations were already working in @entity1 , the @entity232 's poorest country , when the quake struck tuesday afternoon . aid groups scrambled to help in the aftermath of the quake , but were struggling with the same problems as ordinary @entity1 . in a small clinic in @entity0 , doctors were overwhelmed with the causalities coming in . bodies and bleeding wounded seemed to cover every inch of the clinic . a woman with a broken leg sat on the floor next to the body of a dead toddler who was covered by a sheet . she 'd been waiting for treatment since tuesday . a @entity2 crew at the clinic counted at least 13 other adult bodies piled outside . others were still alive , leaning on walls , lying on floors in despair . none of the three aid centers run by @entity260 was operable wednesday , the group said . the organization was focusing on re-establishing surgical capacity so it could deal with the crushed limbs and head wounds it is seeing . the earthquake sheared huge slabs of concrete off structures and pancaked scores of buildings , trapping people inside those buildings , and knocking down phone and power lines . " one woman , i could only see her head and the rest of her body was trapped under a block wall , " said @entity276 , who drove through @entity0 after the quake . " i think she was dead . she had blood coming out of her eyes and nose and ears . " the headquarters of the @entity58 mission in @entity1 , a peacekeeping and police force established after the 2004 ouster of then - president @entity294 , collapsed during the quake , leaving leaving about 150 members unaccounted for , @entity58 officials in @entity288 said wednesday . at least 10 survivors were pulled from rubble at the @entity58 mission , according to former president clinton . the top two civilian officials at the @entity58 mission , special representative @entity302 and his deputy , @entity304 , were believed trapped in the rubble of the hotel that housed the world body 's headquarters , their fates unknown , said @entity310 , the undersecretary - general for peacekeeping operations . the @entity313 - led mission has about 9,000 troops , police and civilian staff in @entity1 , about a third of whom were in @entity0 . at least 16 peacekeepers , including 11 @entity313 , three @entity321 , one @entity322 and one @entity323 , were reported dead wednesday afternoon , @entity58 officials said . also among the dead was @entity325 , the @entity326 archbishop of @entity0 , according to the official @entity328 newspaper . the archbishop was buried beneath rubble along with 100 priests and aspiring priests attending a religious conference , @entity329 told the @entity328 's @entity336 news agency .
