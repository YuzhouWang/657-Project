( @entity0 ) -- on a cold morning in february , 10 days after undergoing in vitro fertilization , @entity1 lay in bed at her @entity5 home waiting for the results of her pregnancy test . @entity9 and @entity1 with daughter @entity10 ( now 18 months ) and sons @entity8 , left , and @entity12 . @entity13 was moving slowly . it was getting late and the call from the fertility clinic should have come by lunchtime . " we were waiting and waiting and the call seemed like it would never come , " @entity1 said . finally , around 4 p.m. , @entity1 's husband , @entity9 , got the call at work . " the doctor told me in one sentence , ' @entity1 is pregnant , but we transferred the wrong embryos , ' " he said . " i did n't even know that could physically happen . it was a total shock , totally beyond the realm of possibility . " in a tragic mix - up , the @entity30 say the fertility clinic where @entity1 underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple 's embryos into @entity1 's uterus . in essence , she had become an unwitting surrogate for another family . after receiving the news , @entity9 hung up the phone and drove straight home to tell his wife in person . " he walked in and was as white as a sheet , " @entity1 said . " he told me , and i think he repeated himself two or three times , and i kept saying ' you 're joking . ' i kept yelling at him stop it but there was nothing on his face indicating a joke . " watch more on the @entity30 and their reaction to their situation Â» @entity55 turned to shock , and when that shock melted , so did the couple 's hope for having another child of their own . at the time , @entity1 was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning . " that was the beginning of a very treacherous and emotional journey for us , " said @entity9 . " i do n't think i 've ever cried so much in my life , " said @entity1 . " it was such a nightmare and , in a way , i felt violated . " that nightmare was the tipping point on a pregnancy path marred by failed attempts and painful miscarriages . only the birth of the @entity30 ' first child was easy . their second child , born almost three years later in 1997 , was 10 weeks premature after @entity1 developed life - threatening complications . " that was a scary time for us , " said @entity1 . yet after she recovered , the @entity30 consulted with a doctor and remained intent on pursuing future pregnancies . it would prove exceedingly difficult . @entity1 and @entity9 tried on and off for 10 years to have another child before turning to @entity87 . eventually , @entity1 became pregnant with the couple 's third child , resulting in another difficult pregnancy and premature birth . their daughter is now a healthy 18 - month - old . with five embryos left over from @entity87 -- and despite the risks to @entity1 's health -- the @entity30 , guided by their religious beliefs , refused to let the unused embryos at the clinic languish . february 6 was when they thought they had three of their own embryos implanted by the fertility clinic . cases like these , while tragic , are exceedingly rare , said dr. @entity107 , a reproductive endocrinologist and past president of the @entity109 . " there are well in excess of 100,000 embryo transfers every year in this country , " said @entity107 . " the fact that this happens once in several hundred thousand embryo transfers means the vast majority of the time , systems do protect from this taking place . " groups like the @entity109 have a series of strong protocol recommendations for in vitro procedures , such as accurately labeling embryos with the patient 's name and @entity129 number , and color - coding samples uniquely to avoid confusion . these identification procedures are not legally mandated , but mistakes can occur if they are not followed , said @entity107 . after learning about the mistake , the @entity30 made two decisions right away : they would not abort the baby , and when he was born , they would relinquish the baby to his @entity139 parents . " they did n't choose this path either , " @entity1 said of the @entity139 parents , who declined to speak with media . " we knew if our embryo had been thawed and negligently put into another woman , we would expect that the child would be returned to us . " the @entity30 are not releasing the name of the clinic where they underwent the @entity87 procedure , but provided @entity0 with proof of their reproductive predicament , including results of amniocentesis , a genetic test , indicating the baby @entity1 is carrying is not theirs . they have met with the baby 's dna parents , and according to @entity1 the @entity139 - related mother of the child has come along for one doctor 's appointment . " we knew based on legal precedent that custody would be lost , and we agree with that precedent , " said @entity1 , alluding to a similar case of errant @entity87 in 1999 in @entity162 in which custody was awarded to the genetic parents . the @entity30 are grimly aware that they will have to do the same thing soon . @entity1 is now 35 weeks pregnant and expecting to deliver within the next couple of weeks . it is a countdown fraught with mixed emotions . " as the process has gone along , it has been exceptionally difficult imagining this playing out , " @entity172 said . " there are so many ways to walk into that delivery room , " @entity1 . " we 're trying to mentally frame it instead of a loss -- it is a loss , i do n't want to say that it is n't -- but we 're trying to look at it as a gift we 're giving someone else . " the @entity30 say the five embryos they originally had cryogenically preserved at the clinic in @entity5 are still unused and have been moved to another clinic in @entity188 , @entity189 . they say doctors have advised against any more pregnancies for @entity1 , so they are working out terms with a gestational carrier , or surrogate , to carry some of those embryos for them . still , even if a surrogate can eventually help them expand their family , the @entity30 say that the memory of the child they gave up will always linger . " i know that tug will be there every day wondering if the baby 's happy , healthy and ok , " said @entity1 . " we want him to know that it was n't that we did n't want him , but too many people wanted him , " said @entity9 . " we gave him up because it was the right thing to do . "

birth mother is continuing with pregnancy and will give the baby to @placeholder parents
