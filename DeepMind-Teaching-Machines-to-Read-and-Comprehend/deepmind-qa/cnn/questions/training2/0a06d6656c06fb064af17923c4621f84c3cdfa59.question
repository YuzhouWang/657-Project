( @entity0 ) -- a year ago , few outside of @entity2 , @entity3 , had ever heard of @entity4 . all that changed last summer when gov. @entity6 accepted the @entity8 vice presidential nomination . on " @entity9 " on wednesday , @entity4 talks about his relationship with the @entity6 family . soon after she entered the national spotlight , it was learned the conservative governor 's teenaged daughter , @entity17 , was pregnant with @entity4 's baby . the @entity20 family saga has been in the news ever since . in a " @entity9 " exclusive interview wednesday night , @entity4 , along with his mother , @entity24 , and sister , @entity25 , talked about baby @entity26 , why he 's not seeing much of his son , what his legal intentions are and the @entity31 ' ambiguous relationship with the @entity32 . the following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity : @entity36 : how are you handling all of this attention ? @entity4 : we 've got people camped outside the house and in front of my sister 's school and that kind of thing . it 's pretty crazy . @entity36 : are you surprised at it ? @entity4 : i lived back in a small town . so i mean i never thought that would ever happen to me . and when she [ @entity6 ] finally told , everybody that @entity17 was pregnant and stuff , i did n't think it was going to get this rough . @entity36 : did the @entity6 family seem close - knit ? what was it like for you dating in the atmosphere of the governor 's daughter ? @entity4 : they always treated me like a son . they were real nice to me . and i thought of her [ @entity6 ] as like my second mother . you know , @entity69 was always a great guy and helped me out with a lot of things . @entity36 : when it began to be sexual and romantic [ with @entity17 ] , did the governor know ? @entity4 : you know , i 'm not sure . that 's a question i ca n't really answer . but , you know , i think ... @entity36 : what do you think ? @entity4 : you know , she says she [ did n't ] know . but i do n't know . i think she 'd probably know , you know ? watch @entity4 's interview with @entity36 Â» @entity36 : what about her husband ? do you think he knew ? @entity4 : i would think so . @entity36 : where did sex occur ? in their house ? @entity4 : you know , @entity36 , that i 'm a gentleman . and i do n't kiss and tell . so i do n't think that really matters . @entity36 : you said you practiced safe sex most of the time , right ? @entity4 : right . @entity36 : we know that one time that did n't happen . were you surprised at the pregnancy ? @entity4 : a little bit , yes . it came as a bit of a shock . @entity36 : how did you tell @entity6 ? @entity4 : we went over there and we had one of @entity17 's friends over there . and we all kind of sat down on the couch and we ended up telling her that way . @entity36 : what did she say ? @entity4 : she was shocked . i mean she probably did n't really know what to say . no mother wants to hear that her her daughter is pregnant at 18 years old . @entity36 : when the baby , @entity26 , was born , was there ever a thought that you would not be the active father of that child ? @entity4 : no. @entity36 : so what happened ? @entity4 : i do n't know what happened . i think somewhere along the lines , we just were n't hitting it off anymore and ... @entity36 : but they wo n't let you see your kid ? @entity4 : no. i can go over there and see him . but it 's kind of an uncomfortable thing for me to go over there . you know , i want to be able to take him and do that kind of thing , go do the father thing with him and i ca n't . @entity36 : why ca n't you ? @entity4 : you know , i 'm not sure . @entity36 : do you have a lawyer ? @entity4 : no. @entity36 : why not ? @entity4 : we 're not in a big fight with the @entity32 . i still like the family very much . i think we can work things out . i do n't think either one of us want to go to lawyers and try to fight for custody and stuff like this . @entity36 : but then why ca n't you take your baby for a weekend ? @entity4 : i do n't know . @entity36 : but you 're not interested in finding out legally why you can ? @entity4 : i am . if it keeps going like this , i think we 're going to have to . ... @entity36 : now , [ upon ] further reflection , you might have a lawyer ? @entity4 : yes , i do . @entity36 : ok . so are you afraid that saying you have a lawyer might anger the @entity32 ? @entity4 : i do n't want to stir anything up ... @entity36 : when was the last time you saw @entity26 ? @entity4 : a couple weeks ago . @entity36 : do you call the house to see how he is ? @entity4 : yes . i call and check up on him every once in a while . and , you know , she [ @entity17 ] keeps the talk short , you know . but i do check up on him . @entity36 : she [ @entity17 ] seems to be really ticked . is there something you did ? @entity4 : that might be the case , but i do n't see what it would be . @entity36 : in other words , you have no idea why she 's angry ? @entity4 : no. i think it has a lot to do with her and my sister . she [ @entity17 ] does n't trust who she hangs out with . @entity36 : have you spoken to the governor ? @entity4 : i have n't talked to her for quite a while , actually . @entity36 : well , would n't you want to know what part she 's playing in not letting her daughter see your son ? @entity4 : yes , that would be nice . i mean , my dad talks to @entity69 a lot . and after we did that first interview with @entity209 [ @entity210 ] , he has n't -- he has n't called , you know . and they just pretty much blew us off . so it 's just getting worse . @entity36 : is there any chance the two of you could get together again ? @entity4 : you know , i do n't see that ever happening . i just hope that we can come to an understanding and become friends and raise this baby together . @entity36 : we told the @entity6 camp that @entity4 would be our guest tonight and asked for a comment . we got this response today from @entity228 , the @entity6 family spokesperson : " @entity17 is focused on going to college , raising @entity26 and advocating abstinence . " [ @entity4 's mother and sister join the interview ] @entity36 : all right , @entity24 , what do you make of all of this ? @entity238 , @entity4 's mother : it 's a whirlwind . i still have n't grasped my whole mind around all this . @entity36 : were you mad at the pregnancy , angry ? @entity238 : @entity245 , i was n't . @entity36 : why not ? @entity238 : he 's talked about babies a lot since him and @entity17 has been together . and he 's always been playing with kids . and i 've always wanted to be a grandma ever since mine grew up , so ... @entity36 : what went wrong , do you think ? @entity238 : i 'm still trying to figure that out . @entity36 : do you think you might have been in the equation , @entity256 , since @entity4 said that @entity17 did n't like you ? @entity257 , @entity4 's sister : i 'm not too sure . i think it 's a big part because of my friends . but i do n't understand why . @entity36 : what kind of friends ? @entity257 : friends that have previously dated my brother , they still talk . and there 's kind of a jealousy issue between her and my friends . @entity36 : somebody is not letting your son see your grandson . you 've got to go somewhere with that . @entity238 : well , that 's what we 're all trying to find out , what to do . @entity36 : have you contacted them ? @entity238 : not personally . i have talked to @entity17 , seeing if i could take @entity26 , come over and get him , bring him to the house . but that has n't happened . @entity36 : what did she say ? @entity238 : she said that she would call me back . @entity36 : and did n't ? @entity238 : no. @entity36 : do you have a guess as to why they 're being this way ? @entity238 : i do n't know . things started changing different , i would say , i noticed in november . things were starting to chill down , not getting as friendly and i 'm not sure [ why ] ... @entity36 : now , he says you do have a lawyer ? @entity238 : yes , we do . we want to keep this on the lowdown and , you know , not start trouble . but , obviously , if things do n't change , that 's our next action when we get back ... @entity36 : an e-mail question from @entity303 in @entity304 , @entity305 , " @entity4 , how much child support do you have to pay each month ? " @entity4 : i 'm not doing any child support right now until we go to court . i have everything my boy needs back home : diapers , toys , everything . @entity36 : @entity24 , in december , shortly before @entity26 's birth , you were arrested on drug charges , right ? what is the status of that case ? @entity238 : i ca n't go there right now . when i have my day in court , then i would love to be able to set the record straight . there 's a lot of misconception out there , but i ca n't go any further than that right now . @entity36 : and you 're through with high school , right ? or are n't you ? @entity4 : no , i have n't taken my final test , no. @entity36 : are you going to do that ? @entity4 : yes .

@placeholder first tells @entity36 he has n't gotten a lawyer , then later says he has gotten one
