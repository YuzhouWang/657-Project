His adult neighbor, the scientist, had asked him to watch it for him for the weekend. He had also asked Johnny not to touch it. But it was a time machine. Johnny had to see it.\newline\newlineThe machine was big and silver and shiny and looked like an ice cream cone that had been dropped. It had a square hole as tall as Johnny and it hummed like a fridge.\newline\newlineJohnny took a deep breath and stepped inside. Just a peek, he thought.\newline\newlineThere were three buttons inside. One said "past," and one said "present." Another said "space."\newline\newlineJohnny looked at the buttons. He looked at the buttons some more. He waited and without thinking, his arm jumped out in front of him. He pushed the button that said "past."\newline\newlineThere was a bright light! And bam!\newline\newlineJohnny stepped out of the machine. It was raining, and there were many strange looking trees. The air was warm. The dirt below was muddy.\newline\newlineHe took a deep breath. "So this is the past," Johnny said.\newline\newlineJust then he heard a bump. And another one. The ground shook. The bumps got louder and the ground shook harder. A tree fell.\newline\newlineJohnny heard a roar.\newline\newlineTwo more trees fell.\newline\newlineSuddenly, Johnny saw it: A Tyrannosaurus Rex!\newline\newlineJohnny was so scared he couldn't breathe.\newline\newlineThe T. Rex looked up, and left, and right. He sniffed the air and leaned down. He didn't seem to see Johnny.\newline\newlineThen Johnny sneezed. And the T. Rex started walking towards him. Faster and faster. Bump. Bump bump. Bumpbumpbumpbump until he was running.\newline\newlineJohnny jumped back into the time machine and pressed "present."\newline\newlineThere was a bright light and Johnny was back home.\newline\newlineHe took a deep breath. He was home.\newline\newline"Phew," he said.\newline\newlineNext time, he would listen to his adult neighbor, he thought.	one: What kind of dinosaur did Johnny meet?
