It was late, it was dark, it was raining, and he was out of cookies. His squirrel was asleep in the passenger seat, as was his hamster, in the back seat. He had gone down to the beach for the day, but it had started raining, so he had started driving back. But he had gotten lost. Now, he thought he was on the right way back.\newline\newlineHis headlights were not very strong. He could only see a few feet in front of him, except when the lightning hit. When the thunder came after, his squirrel, Joey, and his hamster, Broey, turned over in their sleep.\newline\newlineSuddenly, lightning and thunder hit at the same time. There was a bright light and a crunching sound. A tree fell in front of the car!\newline\newlineSam hit the brakes. The car slowed down and stopped, and he got out. Sam walked up to the tree. He tried pushing it. It was too heavy. What would he do?\newline\newlineHe heard the car door open and shut behind him.\newline\newlineIt was Joey! And Broey!\newline\newlineTogether, the three of them pushed. Joey and Broey were small, but strong. And together, they moved the tree.\newline\newlineThey got back in the car. Sam was wet, and turned on the heater. He was tired, but he knew he would get home now - thanks to his animal friends.	one: Why did Sam leave the beach?
