I couldn't believe my eyes, so I put down my ham sandwich I was eating and looked at him. I'm not sure what he thought he was doing there, but he sure did talk a lot. He kept asking me questions about this and then he asked me some questions about that and I was getting a little bit tired of all of the questions.\newline\newlineWhen I thought I wouldn't hear the end of everything, this Jack kid asked me about the one and only secret that I've always kept to myself. That no one even knew about! No, it wasn't about my golden guitar or even my goose that laid eggs filled with coins. No, he was asking me about my beans and their roots. \newline\newlineYou see, I'm a giant and my job is to make sure the bean roots that we use to get down to earth are well protected and guarded. They're what helps us get down to the little person world when we need to. I became a little bit worried as the little kid asked more and more questions about my roots. I didn't want to tell him that my roots were hidden in the library!\newline\newlineI walked over to him to pick this little kid up to get him to quiet down about the bean roots, well, he got me with his little knife and I dropped him! Thankfully, he didn't get hurt or I would've been so sad! \newline\newlineHe ran down the beanstalk when I chased after him. I guess he wanted to get back to his little people. I didn't follow him, but I sure hope he doesn't come back for my stuff.	multiple: What was the secret Jack knew about?
