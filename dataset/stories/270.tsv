She dug around in their white refrigerator and found she would need to go and buy eggs. She also needed to buy icing. \newline\newlineAnnette got on her pink bike and went to the grocery store. She asked the cashier to tell her what aisle the icing was on. Annette went to the aisle 14 and picked out blue, Todd's favorite color. She then went to get the eggs.\newline\newlineAnnette worked for 2 hours making the cake. She decorated it in the blue icing, and even wrote "Happy Birthday Todd" in neat letters.\newline\newlineAnnette's parents made a nice dinner of chicken, red potatoes, and macaroni. After dinner, Annette and her mom and dad sang to Todd. He was excited for the cake and to turn 11, and said Annette was the best sister ever.	one: What is Todd's favorite color?	red	white	pink	blue	multiple: What aisle was the icing on?	2	11	14	one	one: Who is the birthday cake for?
