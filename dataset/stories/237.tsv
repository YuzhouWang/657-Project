It's six in the morning!"\newline\newline"Hello Dad," I said.  My dad thought waking me up early for father-son time was a treat.  I wished we could hang out at night instead. He sat in the chair at the foot of my bed with an enormously cheesy grin on his face, with a big shopping bag on his lap.\newline\newline"What's in the bag, Dad?"\newline\newline"I bought you some presents! You're a growing young man, and it is only right that you pick a sport." Dad dug through the bag, and pulled out a football and a baseball. "Any of these look good?"\newline\newline"Dad, you know all I want in life is to join the circus! Why can't you let me be myself?"\newline\newlineDad leaned in closer to me, a serious look on his face. "Son, when I was eight I wanted to join the circus too. But when I got to high school, everybody made fun of me. They told me I was dumb for not playing sports and dumb for practicing juggling all day. They told me that nobody would marry me if I didn't give up my circus dreams."\newline\newline"Then how did you find Mom?"\newline\newline"By giving up my dreams of circus juggling and playing football instead! Come on, you'll like it."\newline\newlineI slowly pulled myself out of bed and grabbed the football from Dad's hand. I wanted to make him happy. But I wish he could've been happy with a dream where you didn't get hit with things.	one: What time is it?	eight at night	Six in the morning	eight in the morning	six at night	multiple: Why did the Dad play football in high school?	the coach made him	he didn't play football	To marry Mom	for fun	multiple: Which ball did the son not pick	soccer ball	baseball	bowling ball	football	multiple: What did the dad want to do before high school?	play soccer	play football	watch movies	juggle in the circus
