He put down his toy and went over to look. He found a small frog, about two inches cross, jumping across the grass.\newline\newlineCarefully, Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass. He didn't know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs needed water. He wanted to help the frog.\newline\newlineHe ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand. He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard.\newline\newlineIt took him some time to find the frog again. It seemed to be moving slower than it had before. He waited for it to pause, then scooped it up with his bare hands and dropped it into the water. He watched the frog swim around for a bit, and then carried the pail around to the front of the house.\newline\newlineIt was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood. Kerry walked slowly, trying not to spill the water. The pail seemed to grow heavier and heavier as he walked. Finally, he reached the creek. He set the pail down next to the water and tipped it over until the frog was swimming in the stream.	one: What did Kerry normally use the pail to carry?	grass	water	frogs	sand	multiple: Why did Kerry get a pail full of water?	to walk slowly	to play with his airplane	to water the grass	to put the frog in	one: Where was Kerry playing with toys?	at the beach	in the stream	in the house	in the backyard	multiple: Why did Kerry put the frog in the stream?	so that the frog could be with its family	he wanted to save the frog	he wanted it out of the backyard	so he could go back to playing with his airplane
