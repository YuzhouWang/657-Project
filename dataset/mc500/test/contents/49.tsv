It was a nice Saturday afternoon. They both rode their bicycles to the park. Bill and Steve were hoping to use the swings, but when they showed up, the swings were being used by Anne and Susan. \newline\newline"Can we use the swings?" Bill asked the two girls, hoping they were almost done.\newline\newline"Not now," said Anne. "We have only been here for a little bit." \newline\newlineBill was disappointed, but there were so many other things to do at the park. Bill and Steve went to the slide. Up and down they went, faster and faster, every time! It became a race, Bill and Steve ran back to the ladder as quickly as they could so they could go down again.\newline\newlineAfter a half hour, the two boys were very tired from climbing the ladder and flying down the slide so quickly over and over. They went to their bikes to go back home. As they started going home, they saw Anne and Susan had left. They could use the swings before going home!	multiple: When did the boys get to use the swings?
