He heard a noise coming from a nearby rock. He went to see what was making the sound, and Beverly followed him. He looked around the rock, but couldn't see anything. Billy tried to lift the rock with a stick, to see what was under it, but it was too heavy. \newline\newline"I wonder what's making that noise," Billy said. Beverly ate some grass. He went back home. Beverly followed him.\newline\newlineBilly asked his wife, Judy, if she had anything that could lift the rock. She looked around the kitchen and found a spoon and a towel. "Use the spoon to dig under the rock," she said. "Then you can put the towel under the rock, and pull it towards you."\newline\newline"That's a good idea," Billy said. He dug under the rock with the spoon. Then he tried to pull it towards him with the towel, but it was too heavy.\newline\newlineThen Beverly, the lamb, started pushing the rock with her forehead. At first, the rock only rolled around in its hole. Then, when Billy pulled and Beverly pushed at the same time, it rolled downhill.\newline\newline"Thank you, Beverly," Billy said. "I couldn't have done it without you."\newline\newlineBilly and Beverly looked where the rock had been. In the middle of the circle of dirt, they saw a little cave with some baby bunnies in it. The bunnies looked hungry, and were crying for food. Billy went back home and told Judy, and she gave the bunnies some lettuce.	one: What does Billy find under the rock?
