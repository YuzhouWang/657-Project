She told John and Sally to go to the grocer's to buy the things she would need.\newline\newline"I'll need some popcorn, a pea, some melon balls, and a cup of yogurt. I'm going to make a very special cake today," she said.\newline\newline"Wow, that sounds horrible," said John.\newline\newline"Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips," said Sally.\newline\newline"Don't talk back, kids. Do what I said and head into town. It's a beautiful day. Go the long way and follow the river until you get there. Don't take the short way through the forest. A lion has escaped from the zoo. He might be hiding in the forest."\newline\newlineSo John and Sally started the walk into town, but because they were disobedient children, they didn't follow the river like their mother told them. Instead they took the short way through the forest.\newline\newline"I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest," said John. "Besides, I think mom has been eating too many melon balls and is letting her imagination get away from her again. If there were a lion in the forest, we would know about it."\newline\newlineSo they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another. But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest, they heard a terrible roar. It was the lion! Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home.\newline\newline"We're sorry!" they both said to their mother. "We'll never be disobedient again!"\newline\newlineAnd from that day forward, whenever their mother told them to do something, they did it right away like they were told.	multiple: What happened when John and Sally got into the darkest part of the forest?
