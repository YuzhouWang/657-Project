@entity0 is five years old and loves the ocean. When he is in the tub, @entity0 pretends that he is a sailboat racer. He always wins. Sometimes @entity0 stays in the tub too long. When this happens his mother yells at him. Today, @entity0 stayed in the tub too long. His mother was not happy. After getting out of the tub, @entity0 had to brush his teeth. He used his favorite toothpaste. @entity0 does not like cinnamon flavored toothpaste or fruit flavored toothpaste. His favorite type of toothpaste is mint. After brushing his teeth, @entity0 went to bed. His puppy does not like to fall asleep on Tuesdays. He falls asleep quickly every other day. On Mondays and Wednesdays he falls asleep before @entity0! Today, his puppy did not want to fall asleep. @entity0 was tired, but his puppy kept him up too long. His mom told him to go to bed. He finally fell asleep after that.
