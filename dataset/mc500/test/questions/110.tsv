There once was a boy named @entity0 who was a good superhero. He thought he was a superhero, at least. His mommy made him eat his cereal with yoghurt every morning so he could stay strong. Today he had to go to school and he was not very happy about that. After breakfast he walked to the bus stop. There he found his neighbor @entity1, who was also an evil superhero. @entity0 thought she was an evil superhero at least. When @entity0 got to the bus stop, @entity1 made a silly face at him. Then she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk. @entity0 had super powers, so he said yes to the dare. He picked up the worm. It was slimy and gross. It wiggled around between his fingers. @entity0 closed his eyes and licked it. @entity1 laughed so hard, she fell to the ground. But @entity0 felt like a real superhero who had won the day for good kids everywhere. First thing tomorrow, @entity0 would start wearing a cape to school. He hoped his mommy would let him wear it. The bus came and @entity1 was still sitting on the ground laughing. @entity0 had a great, superhero kind of thought. He put the worm in her hair. Now @entity1 was screaming! @entity0 the superhero got in trouble for that.
