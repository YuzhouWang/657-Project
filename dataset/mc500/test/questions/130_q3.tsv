A cowboy named @entity0 wanted to take a vacation from his farm that was named @entity1.  He could not make up his mind where to go, so he saddled his horse and rode east.  The sun was setting in the west and it was orange.  A cold wind was blowing from north to south.  @entity0 rode through a forest of pear trees next to his farm. The first place he came to was a small town full of quiet people and its name was Silence.  No one would talk to @entity0.  He kept riding.  The town was next to a forest of maple trees. The second town he came to was very cold and its name was Ice.  @entity0 was afraid his horse would freeze if he stayed there.  Everyone in the town was wearing large coats and mittens.  The second town was next to a forest of pine trees.  The third town he came to was warm and it was named Sunny.  There were palm trees on the beach.  @entity0 and his horse went to the beach and played in the ocean.  @entity0 took off his boots.  @entity0's hat got wet in the water.  He had to leave it on the beach to dry.  Eventually @entity0 and his horse got hot.  They rode east again. Eventually @entity0 arrived back at his farm.  This confused him because he thought he had been riding in a different direction.  @entity0 learned that there really was no place like home.  He put his horse in the barn and went back into his house.
