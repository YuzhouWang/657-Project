@entity1 was a small boy who, like many small boys, loved to play.  He would play outside.  He would play in his basement.  He would play in his room.  When he played, he would play with lots of things.  Sometimes he played with blocks.  Sometimes he played with cards.  Sometimes he would even play with his sister's dolls.One day, @entity1 became bored.  "Maybe I'll play outside," said @entity1.  He tried to play outside, but it did not seem right.  "I know," said @entity1, "maybe I'll play in the basement."  So he tried to play in his basement, but that did not seem right either.  "I guess I can play in my room," said @entity1.  So he went to his room to play, but he still felt bored.  "Maybe I need to play with something different," said @entity1.  So he tried to play with his blocks, but he was still bored.  "I'll play with my cards," said @entity1, but they were not fun either.  "I'll play with my sister's dolls," said @entity1, but he kept being bored.  @entity1 was starting to get sad, and then his sister @entity0 came in and asked, "Do you want to play, @entity1?"  "Yes," said @entity1.  And they played with blocks, and dolls, and cards.  And they had fun.  As it turns out, all @entity1 needed was somebody to play with.
