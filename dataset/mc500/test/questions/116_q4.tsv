@entity2 was a young girl who lived with her grandma. She went to school every day with her favorite red ribbons in her hair. They were red with black stripes. Although @entity2 loved to wear her ribbons in her hair she saw that not many of the other students would wear ribbons in their hair, making her feel very out of place. So on a cold day @entity2 took the ribbons out of her hair and put her favorite headband on. @entity0 was @entity3's best friend; they shared everything with each other and trusted each other very much. @entity0 asked @entity3,"Dear friend, why are you wearing a headband today"?  @entity2 with a sad face said, " I do not want to look different from everybody else."  @entity0 being the best friend @entity2 had ever had hugged her dear friend and whispered in her ear, "It's OK to be different and not like everybody else. Why some of us are short, some of us are tall, some of us have dark hair, and some of us have light hair. There is often some of us who even have red ribbons with stripes on them. @entity1 is their own person, never be afraid to be who you are." @entity2 hugged her friend and placed her red ribbons back in her hair.
