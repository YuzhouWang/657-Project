There was a princess named @entity2 who was very pretty. She wanted to marry a prince named @entity1, but @entity1 had three sisters that did not want them to get married. @entity1's three sisters were, @entity3, @entity4, and @entity0. @entity3 and @entity4 liked @entity2, but @entity0 did not. @entity0 was very mean to @entity2, and tried to get @entity1 to hate the princess. One night, @entity0 even threw a shoe at @entity2. @entity2 ducked, and the shoe hit @entity1 instead. From that day on, @entity2 knew she would get even with @entity0. She was going to cut off her hair one night. While she was asleep she went into her room and did it with a scissors. When @entity0 woke up she looked in the mirror and screamed. Then after that she did not ever give the princess trouble, since she wanted her hair to be long. Then @entity2 was free to marry @entity1 and lived happily ever after in the castle.
