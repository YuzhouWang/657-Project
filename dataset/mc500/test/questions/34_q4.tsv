@entity0 was good at basketball but she liked soccer more.  She played forward for her soccer team on Saturday morning.  A man in a black and white striped shirt blew his whistle to start the game.  It was hot so @entity0's coach handed out orange slices for the players to eat at half time.  @entity0's team was winning but she was more excited for what she would do in the afternoon.  Her father was going to take her to watch a baseball game.  When the soccer game was over, @entity0 took off her soccer shoes and put them next to her father's running shoes in the back of his car.  @entity0 and her father drove to the baseball game.  After buying their tickets, they went to find their seats.  A man in a green shirt stood at the top of the stairs in their section.  He showed them where their seats were.  @entity0 saw a lot of empty peanut shells on the ground near their seats.  A man in a blue shirt was yelling for people to buy some cotton candy.  @entity0's father bought them hot dogs to eat instead.  @entity0 put ketchup and mustard on hers.  The home team was named the Cardinals and they wore red.  The pitcher threw the first pitch and everyone cheered.
