@entity1 loves singing. But her baby sister is crying so loud that @entity1 ca not hear herself, so she was angry! Her @entity2 said she could try to play with her sister, but that only made her baby sister cry louder.  @entity1 tried to ask the baby to stop crying, but that did not work. @entity1 was getting tired, but she had an idea. She would give her baby sister one of her toy horses. The baby loved horses! The baby played with the horse, but then she started crying again. This made @entity1 sad. She wanted to sing! Then she had a great idea. She would give the baby a pacifier! This worked. The baby stopped crying and @entity1 started singing. @entity0 was so happy!
