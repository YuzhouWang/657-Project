It was @entity7's birthday. She was very excited. She was going to have a sleepover at her house for her birthday. She invited all of her best friends. The party was at One on Saturday. @entity1, @entity4, and @entity6 all arrived at One, but @entity3 was late. She did not come until Two, because she could not find her other shoe. The first thing they all did was go swimming in her pool. They had so much fun. They played with the foam noodles in the pool. @entity4 accidentally kicked @entity3's leg in the pool. After they swam, everyone rinsed off and went inside. They ate cake, opened presents, and watched TV. After it got dark, they ran up and down the stairway, played telephone, and told spooky stories. @entity7 tripped going down the stairs and hurt her foot, but it felt better soon after. @entity6 got scared when they were telling stories, and wanted to call her mom to go home. The other girls told her that it is only a story. She felt better. They all fell asleep at @entity2. @entity7 was the first to wake up at @entity5 in the morning. She made pancakes for her and her friends. They all loved the pancakes, except @entity4. She ate some fruit instead. At @entity0, all the girls went back home. @entity7 was happy that she had such a great birthday party.
