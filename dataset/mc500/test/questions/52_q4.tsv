A small boy named @entity1 was at the park one day.  He was swinging on the swings and his @entity0 friend played on the slide.  @entity1 wanted to play on the slide now.  @entity1 asked @entity0 if he could play on the slide.  @entity0 said no.  @entity1 was very upset and started crying.  A girl named @entity2 saw him crying. @entity2 told the teacher Ms. Tammy.  Ms. Tammy came over and told @entity1 that they could both take turns on the slide.  @entity1 and @entity0 were OK with this. They both took turns on the slide. They all lived happily ever after.
