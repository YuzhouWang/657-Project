There was once a group of kittens who all liked to play together. Their names were @entity1, @entity3, @entity0, and @entity2. @entity1 was the leader of the group, and whatever he said, the others did. One day he said, "Hey, everybody, let's go chase some mice." @entity4 said "Yes!" except @entity2. @entity2 did not want to chase mice. @entity2 wanted to drink some milk. He told @entity1, and @entity1 only said "too bad." So everyone went off to chase mice. The next day @entity1 said, "Hey, everybody, let's go annoy the dogs." @entity4 said "Yes" except @entity2. @entity2 thought it was a bad idea. He told @entity1, and @entity1 only said, "Too bad." So everyone went off to annoy the dogs. Except @entity2. When the cats annoyed the dogs, the dogs became very angry. They started growling. They caught the kittens in their paws. The kittens yelled, "Help us!" @entity2 heard, and he ran over and hissed at the dogs. The dogs could not see @entity2, only his shadow, which looked very big. The dogs got scared and ran away, and the kittens cheered. "Yay @entity2! We'll do anything you want!"
