Sally was walking through the park. The bluebirds were singing and the weather was nice. She waved at her neighbor @entity1, who was taking his kitten out. Then she heard a loud noise. The noise was coming from a nearby tree. She walked over to the tree to take a look and found a puppy curled up by the roots. It was making a loud, sad noise. Sally bent down and picked up the puppy. It quickly quieted down, and licked her face. Sally laughed. The puppy was brown with white paws, and she thought it was the cutest puppy she ever saw. She could not find a tag on him, so she took him home. When she got home, she fed the puppy some meat that she had in her fridge. The puppy seemed to like it. She also gave him a bowl of water and he lapped it all up. Then the puppy yawned. Sally picked him up and brought him to her bed and put him on her pillow. Sally looked at him with a smile. "I'm going to call you...@entity0." @entity0 wagged his tail a little, and fell asleep.
