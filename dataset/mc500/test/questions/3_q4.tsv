@entity1 was on the playground. As he was running towards his friends, he tripped on a classmate's toy truck and fell. He skinned his knee. He got up and saw that the watch that his brother had given him had broken when he fell. @entity1 was very sad about his watch breaking, which was the second bad thing to happen to him today. One of his friends saw that he had fallen. @entity3 heard @entity1 saying that his watch was broken. He was mad at the boy, @entity2, who had left his truck on the playground for @entity1 to fall over. @entity3 tried to tell him that it was not his @entity2's fault that @entity1 had fallen. She said, "Let's take your watch to the teacher. I think @entity0 can fix it." @entity0 fixed @entity1's watch, and told him to be more careful when he was running outside. After his watch was fixed and he felt better, @entity3 clapped. "I told you it would be okay," she said. She and @entity1 went out to play with their other friends.
