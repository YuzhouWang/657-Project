The kid was going for a quick swim. He loved to get out and hop back into the water. When he was out of the pool he liked to dance and run around. Sometimes when he got out he would sit in the chair and get some sun. He liked to work on his skin color. Just like his mommy. He would take his toys and hop in the water with them. He liked to play football in the water the most. He was taller than the other kids his age, so he could play football and not worry about the bigger kids. He could jump into the deeper section of the pool as long as he got back to where he could touch before his mom worried too much. The pool was his favorite place in the world. The boy could imagine he was doing anything. All of his problems went away. It was a very nice place for him to get his energy out and make friends for when he was not at the pool. He loved making friends.
