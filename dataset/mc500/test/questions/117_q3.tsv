@entity3 Catches a @entity0 loved to eat fish as a young girl.  She saw fish as good food. But she asked, "Where do fish come from?"  "People have to catch them," @entity1 said." @entity3 wanted to know how to catch a fish. "People have caught fish from a pole, line, and hook for a long time," @entity1 said."  "I am about to show you how to that."   "Let's take a lunch with us," @entity1 said.  @entity3 chose some fries with ketchup and a bean sandwich. @entity3 also like sweets.  She brought some candy bears.  @entity3 has strange tastes. @entity1 drove to a nearby lake.  It was early.  @entity3 was yawning in daddy's car. The people at the lake had special times for young people learning to fish.  They talked with @entity3 about them.  @entity3 was excited. @entity1 took @entity3 to a small spot on the lake.  @entity1 showed @entity3 how to put a worm on the hook as something to get the fish. @entity1 said other like things like grasshoppers, corn, or tiny fish could also get the fish. @entity3 lifted her pole and dropped her line in the water.  The small red and white float was there on the water.  It was easy to see that from the blue water and sunny sky. @entity3 said, "@entity1 I'm bored." @entity1 told her that sometimes you need to wait. After a short wait, the float went under! "@entity3, you have a fish!" @entity1 yelled. @entity3 lifted up her line and took the small fish out of the water. "@entity1, I can catch fish", she happily said.
