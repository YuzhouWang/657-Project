There once was a clown named @entity0 who traveled with the circus.  He was one of the most famous clowns of all time, because he was once the star of a movie.  @entity0 did a lot of things in his act that were very silly.  He was best known for belting out songs in the wrong key, which would make neighborhood cats meow and howl. @entity0 would do other funny things in his act, like wrestle a big plastic alligator with tape over its mouth.  He would also throw buckets of water at the people watching the circus, wetting all the people in the front seats.  One day, a driver in the circus needed to brush his teeth because he had been eating popcorn all day. He was out of toothpaste, so he went to ask @entity0 if he could borrow some.  @entity0 was eating a brownie, and his mouth was very full.  When he tried to talk, he sounded sillier than ever.  The driver laughed and asked @entity0 to point to the toothpaste. @entity0 pointed over to the sink, and the driver picked up the toothpaste and left.  The driver did not know that it was trick toothpaste that was pumpkin flavor.  The driver hated pumpkin flavor! It tasted so bad. So he took the toothpaste and put it back on @entity0's sink.  He never borrowed @entity0's toothpaste ever again.
