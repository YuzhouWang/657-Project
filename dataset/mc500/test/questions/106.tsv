I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group. The weekend long camp included a lot of different games. One of the games was for fire-building. The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires. There are many different ways you can build a campfire. You can build a lean-to campfire. You can also build a teepee fire. To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground. My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string. We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.
