In their small town there are not very many kids. @entity5 is Eight years old. @entity7 is @entity4 years old. They have been the only two boys since they were born. One day @entity5 saw a White moving truck down the street from his and @entity7's tree house. @entity5 got really excited and told @entity7 about it. @entity7 and @entity5 waited, hoping to see another boy that could join their club.  The @entity0's @entity2 started when they were Six and their dads helped them build their tree house and paint it dark blue.  @entity5 and @entity7 both wanted more friends so they could play team games like baseball and football. @entity7 started day dreaming about playing baseball. @entity5 started thinking about how fun football would be. They do not like playing board games, Go Fish or Old Maid any more. They were both looking out the window of the tree house, waiting for the family to get out of the dark blue van that pulled up next to the moving truck. The sun's bright yellow light made it hard for the boys to see as the van door opened @entity7 looked close and yelled out "There are three boys"!  Both boys got really excited and started walking down the street toward the new family. @entity7 broke into a run and brown dust started coming up from the ground behind his feet. @entity5 started running to catch up to @entity7. They made it to the house quickly and one of the new boys gave a strange look as @entity7 and @entity5 both held their knees trying to catch their breath.  A few seconds later @entity7 stood up and said, "Hi I'm @entity7 and this is @entity5. Do you want to join The @entity0's @entity2"? The boy said, "Sure. Can my brothers be in the club too? And @entity5 said, "YES!" The boy took a step back and said, "Well, I'm @entity6 and my twin's name is @entity3. We are @entity4 and our little brother is @entity1. He's Seven." @entity7 and @entity5 started planning games and made friends quickly with the new boys.
