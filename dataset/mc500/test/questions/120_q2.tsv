@entity3 lived on a boat in the sea.  He went all around the world, to see what he could see. In @entity6, he went to a farm.  There, he saw a barn.  He had some milk from a cup.  The cup was big; @entity1 filled it up! In @entity2, he went to the wild.  He saw a tiger and heard it growl.  From the growl, he ran away.  He wanted to live another day! In England he went riding on a horse.  He had so much fun, up in the @entity0!  The horse grew tired; they stopped to rest.  It was time to move on, it was for the best. In @entity4, he wanted a sandwich.  @entity5 was, he could not choose which!  The tuna salad?  The ham and cheese?  It was too much, he had to leave. In @entity7, he spent a winter.  The houses were frozen, he could not enter!  Where did he sleep, what did he do?  We do not know, not me, not you! @entity3 lived on a boat in the sea.  He'd gone all around the world, but the sea was where he wanted to be.
