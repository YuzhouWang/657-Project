A man named @entity2 had the choice to build a tree house, a garage, a desk, or a cabinet.  @entity2 chose to build something big to share with his kid, so he wanted to make a tree house.  @entity2 had to choose what kind of stuff to make the tree house out of.  @entity1 is popular, but splinters would hurt his son.  @entity0 is very strong, but it would also be very hard to use.  @entity3 is not expensive, but it also bends a lot. The last choice was to give up, but @entity2 really wanted to do this for his son.  It would make him very happy.  @entity2 ended up choosing wood, as it was the most popular choice.  @entity2 went to the store to buy nails, tools, and wood, but forgot to buy glue.  He had to go back there and he finally had everything he needed.  He got started and it was very hard.  One hour went by, then two, then three, then four.  Finally, on the fifth hour, @entity2 finally finished the tree house.  His son ran out and jumped into his dad's arms.  They both looked at it, and @entity2's son gave his dad a kiss for all the hard work he had done.  @entity2 looked at the tree house he had built and was very happy.  He had done it all by himself, and he was happy to see his son being so happy as well. They would have a long summer of playing together in the tree house that @entity2 built.  It was one of the best tree houses ever!
