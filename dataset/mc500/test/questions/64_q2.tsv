Little @entity0 was riding his bicycle all around the party. After all grandma gave him it right now. What fun would it be for @entity0 if he could not show off his new bike? He rode it up and down the hills and through the people at the party. It was his party. @entity4 knew that it was his party. He was turning @entity2, @entity2 candles on the cake and the number @entity2 frosted on, the number @entity2 on his birthday hat. The big @entity2. It was much better than his last birthday. He did not like being Seven. He loved riding his bike closer and closer to people and things. Until he ran right into the big table with his birthday cake. All @entity2 candles flew all over the ground of the lawn. @entity0 was upset, and so was daddy at the big huge mess he made. He could have been more careful daddy said, and looked where he was going. He was right, @entity0 was being too crazy. But it was his party, so he kept riding, with more care this time. He rode his bike up and down. @entity3 and faster. Until @entity0's birthday finally was over, long after it began.
