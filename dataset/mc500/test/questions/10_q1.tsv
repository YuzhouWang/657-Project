One day @entity1's @entity0 had to go for a long ride. He went on this ride because he wanted to get breakfast. With breakfast the dad always loved to get a banana in a drink. This was his favorite drink. But along the ride, @entity1's dad had a scare. The back door was open but someone else shut it and tossed his book. Later he found his book in a white bin. Along with the book, there was a white costume. He thought that maybe this was a sign. So he took the white costume and found out it was a doctor costume. He remembered that his son @entity1's favorite thing to do was play doctor. This made him remember that he never even asked his son @entity1 if he wanted to come for the ride. So the dad turned around and drove all the way home to get his son. He asked @entity1 if he wanted to come out to breakfast. @entity1 got very excited and said he did. @entity1's dad was happy he came back because it helped him make his son happy.
