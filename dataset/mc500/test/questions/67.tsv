@entity0 was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump. There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but @entity0's favorite thing she had was a giant sock. @entity0 was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer. When @entity0 was not chewing on the sock, she was running around in the dump, looking for things to eat, or things that were fun to sniff, or that she could bark at. Still, even when @entity0 was having fun doing other things, her favorite thing of all to do was chew on her giant sock. Sometimes @entity0 would see other animals in the dump. There were always birds around, as well as sometimes a snake, and once even a cat. A deer even came through once. @entity0 was quick to start barking at the cat, and she quickly scared it away and it never came back. The birds were something that @entity0 was always trying to catch. She was never fast enough, they would always fly far away before @entity0 even got close. But that did not stop @entity0 from barking at them whenever she saw them. @entity0 liked being active. Even when @entity0 was all alone, she was active. @entity0 was a happy dog.
