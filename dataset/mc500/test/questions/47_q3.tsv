A little girl named @entity3 went to the zoo with her father and her two brothers.  Her father's name was Jared.  Her brothers' names were @entity2 and @entity1.  They drove to the zoo in their car.  Before they arrived at the zoo, they stopped at a @entity0's and ate breakfast.  @entity3 ate a biscuit.  Her brothers ate sausage and eggs.  Her father drank coffee. All three children loved the zoo.  @entity3's favorite animal was the gorilla.  She loved to watch him jump up and down.  She also liked it when he would pound on his chest and roar.  It was very exciting.  @entity2's favorite animal was the giraffe.  He thought that it looked funny.  He also liked its spots.  @entity1's favorite animal was the crocodile because it looked tough.   @entity3, @entity2, and @entity1 were not happy with the elephant.  He was their least favorite animal.  All he did was sleep in his cage.   @entity3 shouted, "Hey, Mr. @entity4, we want to see you up close!"  The elephant did not wake up.  She yelled a few more times, but the elephant kept sleeping.  She gave up and went to the next animal.   The last animals that they saw were the penguins.  @entity3 and her brothers thought that they were so cute.  @entity3 asked to take one home, but her father said no.
