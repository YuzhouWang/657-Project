My brother @entity3 is Twelve years older than me. He is my best friend, and the coolest human on Earth. Right before I turned Seven one summer, he left home to join the @entity4. He thought about joining the @entity1, the Air-Force, or the @entity0, but he liked the @entity4 better. He was away for a long time. I did not see him again until I was almost Eight! He wrote me letters when he was gone, and sent me stripes from his uniform that @entity2 sewed on my jacket. We hung the flag on our front porch. We missed seeing him, so we talked to him on Skype. We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When @entity3 came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the @entity4 base Four days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the @entity4. @entity2 let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. @entity3's visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the @entity4 on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday. I ca not wait to see him again. Next time, we'll visit him on vacation. I want to see the @entity4 trucks and helicopters.
