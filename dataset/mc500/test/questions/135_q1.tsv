There were four men who all played basketball. They did not play baseball, football, or soccer. Their names were @entity1, @entity0, @entity6, and @entity5. One of them had the best shot in the west. He was so good that he almost never missed a shot. Everyone in the world wanted to be as good as him. @entity0 was the one who almost never missed a shot. He played basketball every day. He could shoot it, dribble it, and run very fast. He could not dunk it. He got so good at basketball, teams like the @entity4, the Shooters, the @entity2, and the @entity3 tried to pick him. He had a very hard time choosing his team. He had to pick a team fast. They needed players so @entity0 had to choose a team. He chose the @entity4. They were his best friends. @entity0 played many games with them and was even their star player. He really enjoyed basketball and had a lot of fun playing the game. He had so much fun that he played it for a long time.
