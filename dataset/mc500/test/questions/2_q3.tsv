A little boy named @entity2 lived on a farm.  His father @entity0 owned the farm.  His uncles @entity4, @entity1, and @entity3 also worked on the farm. The farm had chickens, cows, horses, sheep, and pigs.  He loved to play with all of the animals on the farm, but the horses were his favorite.  He would spend all day riding the horses.  He loved when baby horses were born.  They were born in the spring.  When a baby horse was born, @entity2's father would bring the baby out of the barn for @entity2 to pet.   @entity2 also loved playing in the fields on the farm.  He would run through the meadows trying to catch butterflies.  He also loved to stay up late and catch fireflies in the dark.   @entity2 also loved going fishing in the summer.  On one Tuesday evening, he went to the farm's pond and caught a huge catfish.  The fish was so large that it almost broke his fishing pole.  @entity2 brought the fish in.   The fish looked at @entity2 with sad eyes.  Looking at the fish, @entity2 felt bad that he had caught it.  He threw the catfish back into the pond.   He packed away his fishing pole and went back home.  He told his father about the catfish and how he let it go.   His father said, "I am proud of you for doing that, son."
