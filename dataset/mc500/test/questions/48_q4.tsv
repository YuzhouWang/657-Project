@entity3's @entity0 was feeling happy as he looked into his bedroom mirror. He knew that tomorrow would be his birthday. @entity3 would be seven years old and his daddy was going to take him somewhere special.@entity3's little brother @entity1 was playing with his alphabet blocks on the floor. @entity3 walked over and pat him on the shoulder. "@entity2 said he's taking me to the new yogurt store," he told @entity1. @entity1 is four years old so he asked @entity3 what a yogurt store was. "Yogurt is like ice cream," he told @entity1, "and I'm going to get cherry." @entity1 said that he wanted cherry, too. Then @entity3 walked over to the closet. He looked at his favorite shirt and pants to wear tomorrow. Then he looked at his shiny black pair of shoes. He smiled because he would have a nice shirt, pair of pants, and pair of shoes to wear for his birthday.The two boys then heard the front door open and close. They raced down the stairs to greet their father. "@entity2, I'm ready for my birthday," @entity3 said. "Me too," said @entity1. Their father laughed as he picked them up and carried them upstairs.
