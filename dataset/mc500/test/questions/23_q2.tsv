Once upon a time, there was a little frog in a little castle. The little frog was having a little party with all his little froggy friends. "I want to make them a cake!" he said, and so he went into the kitchen. In the kitchen, there were all the ingredients the frog needed to make the cake. There were eggs, milk, flour, sugar, and yes, frosting. The frog put all the ingredients in a bowl and started mixing them up. "I'm going to make the best cake ever!" he said. He took the cake and poured it into a blue bowl and popped it into the oven. He waited, and then, when it was done, he took it out. It was nice and golden brown. He put pink frosting all over the cake. It looked great! All the people at the party loved the little frog's cake.
