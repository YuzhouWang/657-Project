@entity0 and his uncle went out walking in the woods near the river.  They saw many things when they were in the woods.  They saw a chipmunk, a butterfly, a squirrel and some birds.  @entity0 heard a wolf howl. All of the sudden @entity0 heard a train whistle. It scared all of the animals away and that made @entity0 sad. After a bit, @entity0 heard his Auntie calling for them.  @entity0 hoped that it was time for lunch because he was getting very hungry. He hope that there would be cookies to eat, he did not want for there to be any vegetables.  When they got to the house, his auntie was waiting there with a cake for them.  @entity0 was excited and finished the sandwiches that she had made them for lunch. When they were finished his uncle told him that it was time to go home.  It was getting late and @entity0 was going to be late for his bedtime if they did not hurry.  His bedtime was going to be a little earlier tonight because he had to go visit the doctor tomorrow and so there would be no story time before bed.   @entity0 told his uncle that he had a great day and hoped that they could do it again soon.
