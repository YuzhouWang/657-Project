@entity0 was moving to a different state. He wanted to make the move without spending much money. He thought about driving in his own vehicle, but did not do that. So @entity0 found a shipping company that shipped boxes on trailer trucks. First, @entity0 packed all his stuff in boxes. Then, he borrowed a small truck from a friend. He brought his belongings to the company's location with the small truck. At the company's building, he packed his stuff into a trailer. After all his belongings were in the trailer, he sealed off the trailer with a wooden wall.  The company filled the rest of the trailer with their own stuff. Then they drove it to the same town where @entity0 was moving. After @entity0 flew to his new town, he borrowed another small truck. He drove to the company's location in his new town. There he took his stuff out of the trailer. He carried it to his new house in the small truck. It was more work than using a normal moving company, but @entity0 saved a lot of money.
