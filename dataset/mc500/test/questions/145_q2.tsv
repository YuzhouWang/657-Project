She was not sure what to think about it."What if he cries?" asked @entity0."If he cries we hold him until he is quiet," said @entity0's dad."What if he makes a mess in his diaper?" asked @entity0."Diapers smell but we clean them up," said @entity0's mom.@entity0 thought about having a baby brother.  Her mom and dad would take care of him. They bought a high chair for him to eat in.  They brought out her old crib for him to sleep in.  What could she do to help?  @entity0 wanted to help the baby play.  She thought it would be fun to play with him.  @entity0 saved up her money.  She had two whole dollars.  She went to the store to pick out a present for the baby.  She bought a rattle.  It cost all the money she had, but @entity0 was happy.  She could give a gift to the new baby.
