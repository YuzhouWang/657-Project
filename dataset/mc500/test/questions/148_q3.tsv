@entity0 and his mother were building a racing car. They were going to enter it into a race on Saturday. They began building the racing car on Monday. First, they had to build the body of the car. @entity0 wanted it to look like a strawberry! So they colored it red and put little dots all over it. On Tuesday, @entity0's father helped them put the wheels on the racing car. His mother had to hold the car's body up when his father put the wheels on. On Wednesday, @entity0 and his mother colored in the number Eight on the car. This was @entity0's lucky number! On Thursday, @entity0 and his mother tested the racing car at a park near the river. It went really fast! On Friday, @entity0 and his mother and father were outside in their backyard, still practicing with the racing car, making sure it went as fast as it could. @entity0 really wanted to win the race! On Saturday, @entity0 and his mother went to the race. It was being held on the track at his school. They put their racing car on the track, and a man started to count down from @entity1. @entity1, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, GO! @entity0 pushed his car forward as fast as he could! It reached the finish line before everyone else! @entity0 won the race!
