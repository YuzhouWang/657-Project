Once upon a time there was a little elf named @entity2.  @entity2 longed for a goldfish more than anything in the world, so he begged and begged his parents for one.  Finally, his parents told him that he could have a goldfish if he found it himself. With that, @entity2 set out to look for a goldfish.  First he looked under his pillow.  No goldfish there.  Then he looked in the fridge.  No goldfish their either.  Frustrated, he went to his friend @entity0.  @entity0 was an alligator.  @entity2 asked @entity0, "@entity0, where could I find a goldfish?" @entity0 thought long and hard.  Then he thought some more.  He thought even more after that.  At long last, @entity0 spoke.  "I have an idea," he said, "but you must do a few things for me first.  First you must clap for me." @entity2 clapped many times.  "Now," spoke @entity0, "You must chirp like a young bird."  @entity2 chirped happily.   "Last," said @entity0, "You must fold my laundry.  It is behind the wood pile."  @entity2 quickly set to work folding the laundry.  When he was all done he returned to @entity0. "@entity0," he asked, "Where can I find a goldfish?" @entity0 smiled as he spoke, "Fish swim, yes?  @entity1 in a place with water." @entity2 quickly returned home and began his hunt.  First he looked in his drink cup.  No goldfish there.  Then he looked in the toilet.  What he saw in the toilet surprised him.  There was a goldfish swimming in the toilet!  As it turned out, it was a very special goldfish.  The fish was a funny color.  It was not red.  It was not orange.  It was not green.  It was blue!  @entity2 named his goldfish Apple Cracker and they quickly became friends.
