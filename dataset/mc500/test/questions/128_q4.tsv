It was a boring day out on the range for cowboy @entity1. He was riding around on his horse. It was a good animal, and its name was @entity0. @entity0 was an old friend to @entity1. He had been carrying @entity1 around on his back for almost five years, and both of them knew every inch of the range on which they rode. @entity1's job was to keep watch over the cattle who ate and grew fat off the nice grass which grew on the range near the farm. It was a good job for cowboy @entity1. He was a friendly cowboy with a nice beard, but he still preferred to be alone most of the time. He never got lonely on the range, with his horse @entity0 to keep him company and the nice view. As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still @entity1 was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared. Watching the sun rise orange in the distance was always a fun way for @entity1 to start the day. Sometimes, @entity1 would even sing to keep the cattle calm. @entity1 also had to keep the other animals away from the cattle, the wolf and the snake and the coyote. @entity1 and @entity0 were happy having each other as friends.
