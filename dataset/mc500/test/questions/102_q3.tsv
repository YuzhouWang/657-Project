@entity1 really wanted to get a pet. She really liked animals, and her parents said she was ready. What kind of pet did she want? She wanted a pet that was not too loud. She did not want it to wake her up early! She wanted a pet that was not too calm. She wanted it to make her laugh! She wanted a pet that was a pretty color. She wanted to show her pet to all her friends! She asked everyone what kind of pet she could get. "Get a pig," said her teacher, Ms. Hammerstein. "Pigs are pink, and pink is a good color." @entity1 went to the pet store to get a pig. "Oink!" said the pig. "Oink oink oink!" It was very loud. @entity1 did not like the pig at all. "Get a cat," said her sister, May. "Cats are funny." @entity1 went to the pet store to get a cat. "Meow!" said the cat. It was not too loud, but it was a boring grey. That was not a pretty color at all! "Get a turtle," said her brother, @entity2. "Turtles are a pretty green and they are not very loud." @entity1 went to the pet store to get a turtle. It did not say anything, because turtles do not say much. It did not do anything either. It was too boring for @entity1. "Oh no!" said @entity1. She was very sad. "There are no good pets for me!" She was about to give up when she saw a bowl on a table. It had water and a little fish in it. The fish was a pretty orange color. It swam in circles all around its bowl. It did not say anything. It was perfect! "I want the fish!" @entity1 said, and she bought a new goldfish. She named him @entity0, and they were very happy together.
