@entity7 was @entity1's birthday.  He was very excited.  He wanted to invite all of his friends.  "We only have enough cake for five friends." His mother said.  @entity1 thought and thought.  He wanted to invite @entity5, @entity3, @entity6 and @entity4.  @entity1 could invite one more friend. He thought about @entity0. @entity0 was lots of fun and always told funny jokes.  He thought about @entity2. @entity2 was super nice and always made @entity1 feel good.  He also thought about how not inviting one of his friends would make them feel bad.  @entity1 did not want to make anyone feel bad. After a little bit he had an idea.  He told his mother his idea."I like both @entity0 and @entity2, and I want them both to come.  One would feel really left out if they did not get invited.  I can give my cake to one of my friends, and that way they can both come and have a piece." His mother thought it was very sweet of @entity1 to give up his piece of birthday cake so that none of his friends would feel left out."I'll tell you what." Said his mother.  "I'll make a batch of cupcakes, and all of your friends can have some."
