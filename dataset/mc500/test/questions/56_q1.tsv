@entity0 woke up to go to his first day of school on Monday. He woke up to his dog barking at him. His parents gave him a ride to school. When he arrived at school, he went to his first class which was gym class. In gym class, his gym teacher made him run laps around the track because he had been late to class. After he had ran his laps, he played baseball with his friends. @entity0 had wanted to play kickball or basketball, but his friends had chosen to play baseball. After gym class was over, he went to @entity1 class. In @entity1 class, he read a story about a lady who had fallen in love with a kitty. One day the kitty jumped out of the window in the lady's house and never came back. The lady was sad and wondered why her kitty would leave her. @entity0 was very moved by the story. After @entity1 class was over, he went to his third class of the day which was math. @entity0 kept quiet in his math class because he did not know the answers to most of the questions the teacher was asking. After his math class, he went to the fourth and last class of the day which was arts and crafts. In arts and crafts, @entity0 painted a picture that he was very proud of. When art class was over, @entity0 was happy because he had finished his first day of school. He was excited to go to school on Tuesday and Wednesday.
