@entity1 liked his old sneakers but they were getting too small.  He tried on sixteen different pairs of shoes at the mall with his mom.  He was looking for green shoes with blue laces.  He could not find any he liked and left sad.  His mom wanted to cheer him up.  They stopped for lunch at a restaurant drive-thru.  "What do you want to order?" asked @entity1's Mom as she got a cheeseburger and a large drink.  He ordered a hamburger.  While they ate, @entity1 and his mom talked about different shoes @entity1 might try on next.  He did not want to go back to the store, but he really wanted green shoes.  He ate some of her fries as he thought about it.  Suddenly, his mom had a great idea.  They would paint a pair of new shoes green!  @entity1 loved that idea.  So they went to the @entity0 and bought green paint.  They went back to the mall and bought new blue shoelaces and white sneakers.  @entity1 was so excited about his shoes that he painted them as soon as he got home.  Afterwards, he walked around the house in his new shoes dripping green paint.
