One day, @entity0, who was getting ready to walk down to school, could not find his favorite hat. He began looking all over the place for it, his room, the kitchen, even outside. It was nowhere to be found. He was running late for school and did not want to be marked absent so he went to school without it. At school, @entity0 kept becoming upset because he could not find his hat. When @entity0 got home his hat was sitting there next to his goldfish. His mom had found it. It was in the kitchen the whole time.
