The room had a high ceiling and white walls. The lunch was in the center of the room on a stand. The hamster was the first to see the lunch and ran over to it. "What a delicious lunch," he said, "I wish there was something for me to eat it with!" The hamster heard a noise in the corner and jumped up to look and see what it was. It was piggy. "Why do you need something to eat it with?" @entity0 asked, "I roll around in my food and that works out well for me." "I was taught better manners than that," said the hamster, "I would at least like to find a fork to eat with."  "I've heard they have forks in the farmhouse," said @entity0. "The farmers and their kids eat with them all the time. If you want, you can climb on my back and we can make a trip to the farmhouse together." The hamster and @entity0 set off on their trip.
