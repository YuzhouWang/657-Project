The grass was wet with as it always was in the early morning. This made @entity0 very happy. It meant she was up early enough to get to the phone store in time to get the special new phone before anyone else. She brushed her hair and threw on her clothes. She was ready. She would make it there on time.She started her way down the stairs and ran into her grandmother. Her grandmother was always up early. She wished her a good morning before she rushed out the door. She almost fell over her younger brother's seesaw as she came out the door. This was because she was in such a rush. She moved it out of the pathway. She grinned as her friend's car pulled up in front of her house. They made their way to the store and found out they were not the first one there. There was ten people in line before them. @entity0 was kind of disappointed, but too excited to get her new phone to care.
