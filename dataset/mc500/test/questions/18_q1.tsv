One day, a dad and his daughter, named @entity0, went on a trip to pick pears from a tree. @entity0 was wearing a pretty pink shirt and her dad was wearing a green shirt. @entity0's dad gave her a hug as they walked to the pear tree. When they picked pears, @entity0's dad had to lift her on his back, because she could not reach the pears high in the tree. @entity0 and her dad picked thirty four in five hours! @entity0 was hungry, so her dad said she could eat one of the pears they picked. While she was eating, she did not say a word, but after she was done she said it was very tasty.  She said it was green and squishy so she needed a towel to wipe her face after she was done eating.  When they got home, @entity0's grandmother told her how proud she was of her granddaughter for picking all of the pears from the tree.  As @entity0 was standing in the kitchen, watching her mom and sister put thirty three pears in the freezer, she thought about how much fun she had picking pears.
