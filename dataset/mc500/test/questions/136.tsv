@entity0 went with her family swimming to the pool. @entity0 and her brother, @entity1, get along really well and they always have so much fun at the pool together. This time, there was a huge storm coming. As they were swimming, the life guard told everyone to get out of the pool. The life guard also warned everyone of the storm. @entity0 and @entity1 got out of the pool as fast as they could and went to a safe place and waited until the storm was over. @entity0 started to get worried as the storm got worse and worse. @entity1 told her not to worry because he did not think the storm was very bad and that he thought it was almost over. As he told her about the storm, a man walked by and told them that the storm was almost over and that they could go back and swim in a little bit. @entity0 was very happy to hear that she can go back to having fun in the pool with her brother. When the storm was over, @entity1 and @entity0 walked to the store to get some candy before they raced to the pool and jumped in.
