I was really scared walking into school today. It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year. My name is @entity0, but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I did not want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. @entity3 took roll call. She seemed nice, and I'm happy we were not told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. @entity3 called out @entity1, @entity7, @entity6, @entity2, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were @entity5 and @entity4.@entity5 said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and @entity4 seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!
