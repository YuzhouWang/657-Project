There once was a dog named @entity1.  @entity1 belonged to a family, the @entity2, but he was most loved by @entity0. @entity0 was the youngest child in the house, she lived there with her mom, dad and older brother Fred. @entity1 would sleep with @entity0 every night, and wake up with her every morning. Together they would eat cheese and ham for breakfast every day! One day after breakfast @entity0 was getting ready to go to school, but something scared her! There was a big storm.  @entity0 was too scared to go to school with all of the thunder and lighting.  @entity1 could tell @entity0 was scared, and did the only thing a dog could do, @entity1 walked with @entity0 to school the whole way so she was no longer scared!
