One day a man named @entity2 was walking down the block near the park when he came across a butterfly. The butterfly was on a flower in the park. The butterfly was named @entity0. @entity2 watched as @entity0 flew from the flower to a telephone down the block. He followed @entity0 and watched her land on the phone. He felt curious about why @entity0 was sitting on the phone. Because of that feeling, he picked up the phone and all of a sudden he passed out. When he woke up he was in a warmer place than before. He looked around and saw that he was on a small piece of land in the middle of the ocean. Its name was @entity3, but @entity2 did not know that. He looked behind him and saw a forest and a big volcano. Next to him there was a cat named @entity1. @entity2 felt happy to be in such a nice place. He got up. @entity1 ran away into the forest. @entity2 looked at the ocean, but he could not see anything else there. He followed @entity1. After walking through the forest for a short time he got tired and sat down.
