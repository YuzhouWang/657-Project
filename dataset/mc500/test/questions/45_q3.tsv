@entity4 loves to have parties! @entity0 says that he has the best parties in the neighborhood.  He invites all of his friends to his farm and cooks lots of food. @entity3 is @entity4's best friend. @entity3 often comes over to the farm early to help @entity4 cook the food.  They like to make sandwiches, salad, pasta and bacon.  @entity3 always makes the pasta.  @entity5 also comes to help @entity4 decorate the farm. @entity5 likes to put up lots of pink decorations all around the farm. She also brings her friend @entity1. @entity1's favorite colors are blue and green so she brings plenty of blue and green balloons to help make everything look pretty.  After everyone has finished setting up the farm all the guests come over.  @entity2 is always the first person to show up.  He brings fried chicken and likes to eat a lot of food.  He always eats a plate of bacon first.  When he is done he eats a big plate of pasta.  When everyone else arrives at the party, they play a game in the living room.  @entity4 enjoys playing pin the tail on the unicorn.  Whoever wins the game gets a big piece of cake.  Last time they played, @entity1 got the cake.
