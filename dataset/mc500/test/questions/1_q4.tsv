On the farm there was a little piggy named @entity1. @entity1 was very sweet, but he was always dirty. He loved to roll around in the mud. @entity0 of the other piggies wanted to play with him. He wished they would be his friends. One day he was going on a walk on the farm. He walked by and saw his favorite big tree. He walked farther than he ever had before. He saw a bunch of pretty flowers. Then he saw something that he had never seen before. It was a river! He ran down to the river, shouting with joy. He got down low in the cool water swam around for a bit. He ran back to the farm where the other piggies were. He was finally clean. They all played games until dinner time. When it was time for dessert the piggies each got a cupcake. Looking at all his new friends, @entity1 smiled and took a big bite of his tasty treat.
