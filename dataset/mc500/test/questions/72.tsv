@entity0 rode his bike quickly.  It was Friday and he wanted to get to the lake.  The path to the lake was long and winding.  It was wetter on Tuesday.  @entity0 had to wash his boot.  His boot had once been frozen.  It was frozen because he left it outside on Sunday.   He had to leave his boot outside for a long time.  The lake was facing the tree.  @entity0 had to go home.  He wanted food very badly.  @entity0 went home.  He got inside and looked up at the ceiling.  He walked to the refrigerator.  @entity0 took the yogurt out of the refrigerator.  Some milk was on the table and he grabbed a cup so he could pour himself some of the milk.  @entity0 also had a candy bar.  @entity0 sat down and rested.  He was tired from the long bike ride.  He finished his yogurt and began planning his next trip to the lake.  It would not be long before he returned.  He and his boots were ready for more fun outdoors Monday.
