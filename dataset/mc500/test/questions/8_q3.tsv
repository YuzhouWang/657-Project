The sound of the women washing laundry down at the lake woke @entity1 up. She yawned, stretching out like a lazy cat. Her sister was also awake. "@entity1", @entity0 whispered, "are you awake?" @entity1 nodded and rolled out of bed. @entity0 rolled over and went back to sleep.  As @entity1 walked down the hallway, she accidentally stepped on @entity2's tail. "Woof!" @entity2 yelled, in pain. "Sorry, @entity2", said @entity1.  @entity1 went down the stairs and into the kitchen. She ate some milk and cereal for breakfast. Then she sat down to write a letter to her dad. As she was writing she heard @entity2 playing with his ball.  @entity1's dad was a driver for a rich family in @entity3. She had only met her dad in person once, but they wrote letters to each other every week. Her dad was a very busy man, and he did what he had to for his family. Sometimes @entity1 wished she could go to @entity3, too. It was not fair that the other girls got to see their dads every day.  After writing a page, @entity1 stopped. Her hand was covered in the black ink of the pen. She washed her hands and dried them. Then she went outside to wait for the postman. She would mail her letter right away.
