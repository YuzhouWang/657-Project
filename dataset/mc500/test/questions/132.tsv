@entity3 is plentiful in @entity4. When people think of @entity4 they think of these machines called "pump-jacks." A pump-jack is a machine that pulls @entity3 out of the @entity1. @entity2's job is to fix pump-jacks. So he travels to @entity4 to see if he can help. @entity0 owns many pump-jacks and is having a very tough time keeping them working. During the summer in @entity4 the temperature can be over One hundredZero, which causes these machines to break often. @entity2 runs into @entity0 at a restaurant on a very hot day. After they talked about the weather for a few seconds, @entity0 says "my machines keep breaking because of this heat!" @entity2 says "@entity0, I think you and I are both in luck because I fix pump-jacks." Immediately, they both travel out to @entity0's land and @entity2 gets to work!
