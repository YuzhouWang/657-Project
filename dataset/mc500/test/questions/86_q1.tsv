@entity0 and @entity3 had been best friends since @entity1. They had become friends on the very first day, since both of them loved airplanes. @entity3 had made a paper plane for his friend @entity2, but he let @entity0 play with it as much as she wanted. He ended up giving it to her and making a new one for @entity2, and another for himself. To thank him, she made him a paper heart. When it was recess, they went outside and flew their planes high into the air. They laughed when @entity3's plane landed on the teacher's head. She laughed too and gave @entity3 back his plane.Now that they are older, @entity0 and @entity3 are learning more about planes and flying. Neither of them had ever been in a real airplane, but they watched them in movies and wanted to fly in one. @entity0's mother knew about their dreams and set up a small trip for them across the state. As they were riding in the car, the kids could not contain their excitement. They talked all about what it would be like to finally fly in the sky and wondered about the things they would see. @entity0's mother gave them a book about airplanes to read during the trip.When they got on the plane, @entity0 became afraid. Her mother calmed her down and gave her a new doll to hold to help her feel safe. When the plane took off, @entity0 and @entity3 both shouted with happiness and watched out the windows. They watched the ground get smaller and smaller and finally disappear. They sat back in their seats, ready to enjoy the ride.
