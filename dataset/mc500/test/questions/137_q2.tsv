June and @entity0 were playing outside in their yard on a winter day. @entity0 was making pies and cakes out of mud. June was writing her ABCs in the sand with a button she found. June's mom told the girls they were going to the store soon and not to get dirty. @entity0 knew she would get in trouble but she kept playing in the dirt because she liked pretending to cook. Her mom cooked and @entity0 wanted to be grown-up like her mom. June looked down at her blue jeans and saw the dirt. "Oh No!" she said to @entity0. @entity0 looked down at the mud on her shoes and shirt.  She smiled, "@entity2my says cooking is messy business!"  "What are we going to do? @entity2 is going to be so mad!" June worried.  "We can tell her we were thinking as we played, she always says school is not only a place." @entity0 said.  "That will not work!" June cried.  "Wait! I have an idea." @entity0 said as she wiped her hands on the back of her blue jeans.  @entity0 walked over to June's fence and pulled out the prettiest prized purple flowers from the bush.  June looked at her friend more worried.  @entity0 walked past June and knocked on the door with the purple flowers in her hand and a big smile on her face.  Mrs. Jones answered the door looking mad.  Before she could say anything @entity0 said, "Look Mrs. Jones we picked you flowers and June did her ABCs."  Mrs. Jones wanted to be mad at them but their smiles warmed her heart.  "Thank you dear. @entity1 go change clothes and rinse off for our trip to the store.  The girls walked in the house leaving a trail of mud on the floor.
