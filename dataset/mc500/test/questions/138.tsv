@entity0 woke up early on Saturday morning. She was very happy because her cousin, @entity1, was coming to visit today. She was also happy about the new kittens. They were only a few weeks old, and so cute! @entity0 ran into the kitchen. Her mother was cooking breakfast."I ca not wait to show @entity1 the new kittens," @entity0 announced to her mother. "Do you think her mother is going to allow her to have one?""I do not know," @entity0's mom answered. "I hope so. Six kittens - that's too many! I only want to keep two kittens. She is going to be here soon."@entity0 hurried through breakfast and ran outside to wait on @entity1. She jumped up and down with excitement when she saw a car turn into the driveway. @entity0 ran toward the car as @entity1 opened the door. "We have new kittens," @entity0 announced with a smile. "Mom says you can take one home.""Can I Mommy, please," @entity1 asked her mother."I need to think about it," said @entity1's mother."Come on!" @entity0 said and ran toward the barn where the kittens were. @entity1 ran after her.@entity1 and @entity0 played with the kittens all day.
