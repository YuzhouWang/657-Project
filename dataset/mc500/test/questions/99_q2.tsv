@entity0 was excited about the trip he was taking tonight. The family was going out to his favorite place to eat. @entity0 loved spaghetti and meatballs, and the restaurant made the very best! When @entity0 and his parents got to the restaurant, his mother had to tell him to stop running so fast. @entity0 could not help himself, he wanted to be inside and at a table so badly. The restaurant had pictures of all the people that used to work there in the past, it had been around for a long time with a history of such great food. It was not the first time his mother had to tell him to slow down. When they were taken to their table and went through the curtain to the dining area, @entity0 had another nice surprise waiting for him. It would not be a table for three, his favorite aunt and uncle were waiting at the table for them! @entity0 sat down quickly to get some of the bread sticks before they were all gone. @entity0 did not even need a menu, he knew what he wanted. @entity1 on the spaghetti and meatballs, nice and hot!
