The girl was scared.  She had been lost in the woods for over an hour.  Then she heard something howling in the distance.  Finally, it was getting dark.  It all made her more scared than she had ever been.  The howling grew louder.  Then the girl came into a small opening in the woods.  And she saw the wolf!  She was so scared she cried out, "Please do not eat me Mr. @entity0!"  A grey wolf, with grey fur, black eyes, and white teeth looked at her.  Then he let out a big, wolf laugh.  "Haha, I am not going to eat you! I do not like to eat humans!  They taste bad.  Plus, I am full!  Do you want some spaghetti?  It's been cooking for days! I was going to make some salad but I am out.  I'll go to the grocery store tomorrow, I have not been there in months!"  The girl was confused.  A wolf who ate salad? But she was hungry.  So she sat down and ate with the wolf.  He was so pleased she ate with him he gave her a map.  Then he showed her how to get out of the woods.  Her mother would never believe her.
