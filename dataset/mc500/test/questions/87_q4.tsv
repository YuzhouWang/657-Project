@entity2 the race car loves to race. She loves to take lots of laps around the track. Sometimes, she likes to race her friend @entity0 the race truck. Most of the time, she wins. But one very special day, @entity0 was feeling very fast. He filled up on gas that morning and was ready for action. He asked @entity2 to race him. They had to go around the track ten times. @entity2 could not wait. She thought she could beat him. They sat and the finish line and the light changed from red, to yellow, to green, and the race began! They drove around the track at lightning speed. @entity1 and faster @entity2 went. @entity2 seemed to be losing speed. One of her back tires was feeling strange. She slowed down and frowned. @entity0 saw his friend had stopped. He turned around to see what was wrong. @entity2 told him her tire was about to fall off. He pulled her to the shop and they got the tire fixed. He did not win the race, but he won a best friend.
