Once there was a turkey named @entity0, who enjoyed playing house, playing football and riding his bicycle all the time. His favorite food would be corn, which he enjoys licking when it is still on the cob. But his parents spank him to try to get him to stop doing that, as he often burns his tongue when the cob is too hot. He enjoys watching football games as well, he always cheers and claps for his favorite team, the @entity1. In a game he watched last week, the other team, a chicken team named the @entity2, were playing as well. It was a close game, but the @entity1 ended up winning with a little luck. @entity0's best friend was also watching the game, Tony the lizard, and they both enjoyed watching the game together!
