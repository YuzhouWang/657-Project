@entity1 the spider was a small little spider. Her brother @entity0 was bigger than her. Her mother @entity2 was even bigger than @entity0. Her father @entity3 was bigger than @entity0 too, but was not the biggest spider of the family. When @entity1 got mad, she would kick her brother @entity0. Even if @entity0 was bigger than @entity1 he would yell and run away. @entity0 was always getting mad at @entity1, because she got all the attention. Even when @entity0 would do all the washing, sweep the floor and clean the sink, still he did not get any attention. All @entity2 had to do was suck her thumb and look cute. @entity2 was better at reading than @entity0 and he thought this was why he did not get as much attention. @entity1 was younger, but smarter than @entity0. @entity0 did not think this was fair, because even if he was not as smart, he worked hard and was always a good spider.
