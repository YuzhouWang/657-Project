There were Two best friends named @entity3 and @entity2. They were not friends with @entity0, a girl in the same class. And they were not friends with @entity4. @entity4 was not their friend because he did not talk to @entity3 and @entity2. @entity4 did not talk to anyone.  @entity0 talked to everyone, but she did not keep secrets she was told and she said  bad things about the people around her all the time. No one liked her. @entity1 thought she was mean. One day, @entity3 and @entity2 were playing with their puppy near a big tree when they found @entity0 sitting under the tree crying. @entity0 was sad that no one wanted to be her friend. @entity3 and @entity2 felt bad for @entity0. @entity2 told @entity0  she would have a lot of friends if she did not say such mean things about people. @entity3 said that was not true, because @entity4 did not talk about people and he had no friends.  @entity3 and @entity2 thought about it a long time. @entity3 and @entity2 brought @entity0 to meet @entity4. @entity0 and @entity4 became friends soon and @entity0 learned not to say mean things about people. @entity1 was happier.
