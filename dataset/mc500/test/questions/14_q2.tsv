Hi there! How are you doing today? I was hanging out with my friend earlier today. I am looking for a guy in a blue shirt and blue pants. Have you seen him? I cannot find him, and I thought I looked everywhere. I have checked behind the green couch and he was not there. I looked inside the white refrigerator and he was not there either. I looked to the left and looked to the right of the television and he was not in those places either! Where would you look for someone? Where would you look in their house? I think he could be in one of the other rooms here. I checked in the living room and it was empty. I checked in the bedroom and it was empty too! I knocked on the bathroom door and that was empty. It is easy to find him because he is in blue. @entity0, what's that? You said you saw someone in the kitchen? What were they wearing? Were they wearing a blue shirt? Oh they were not? I think that could still be my friend! I'll head over to the kitchen, you can follow if you want. There's my friend! And he's wearing an orange shirt now; he must have left to change his shirt. Thank you so much!
