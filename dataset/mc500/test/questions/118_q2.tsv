@entity1 rides her bike @entity1 was excited.  Today was her seventh birthday and she picking out her present.  It was a new pink bike with a basket and bell.  It was much prettier than her old red and white bike.  The bell on her old bike did not ring, and the basket on that bike was torn. The only problem was that @entity1 could not ride a bike yet.  Her old bike had training wheels, but her new one did not.   @entity1 wanted to ride her bike, but she was scared.  @entity2 told her, "@entity1, everyone is scared at first, but once you try, you are going to learn and stop being scared." @entity1 watched her friends riding their bikes.  First Owen rode by the house and back up the street.  Then along rode @entity4 and @entity3.  @entity1 was sad.  She wished she could go riding with them. @entity1 finally chose to learn to ride her bike.  She put on a helmet, elbow pads and knee pads.  She was ready for battle! @entity0 and @entity2 went out with @entity1 and watched her start to pedal down the street.  After a small bit, the bike tipped over.  She sat on the road looking sad.   She looked so cute sitting there that @entity2 wanted laugh, but instead said, "@entity1, you can do it.  Go again." @entity1 tried several more times, and soon was riding!   She went down the street and back again.  Here came her friends with their bikes.  @entity1 shouted, "wait for me," and joined them riding down the street.
