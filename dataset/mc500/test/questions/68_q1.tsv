@entity2 could hear the birds singing outside the classroom window.  She could see some of them sitting on the branches of an apple tree.  Mrs. @entity0 checked to see if everyone was present.  Each child called out when they heard their name.  She then asked for a volunteer to read a story about a family of grasshoppers.  Many hands were raised but she picked @entity2's friend, @entity3.  While @entity3 was reading the story, she got a tickle in her throat. She began to cough.  Mrs. @entity0 told her to go get some water to drink and a boy named @entity4 finished the story.  Next, Mrs. @entity0 showed the class a butterfly garden.  @entity1 asked if butterflies ate other bugs.  Mrs. @entity0 said that butterflies do not eat but only drink.  @entity2 was chosen to pass out turkey sandwiches for lunch.  Mrs. @entity0 went to the refrigerator.  She got out some vanilla yoghurt for each of the boys and girls.  All the students cheered.
