One morning, @entity1 was giving some milk to his lamb, @entity0. He heard a noise coming from a nearby rock. He went to see what was making the sound, and @entity0 followed him. He looked around the rock, but could not see anything. @entity1 tried to lift the rock with a stick, to see what was under it, but it was too heavy. "I wonder what's making that noise," @entity1 said. @entity0 ate some grass. He went back home. @entity0 followed him.@entity1 asked his wife, @entity2, if she had anything that could lift the rock. She looked around the kitchen and found a spoon and a towel. "Use the spoon to dig under the rock," she said. "Then you can put the towel under the rock, and pull it towards you.""That's a good idea," @entity1 said. He dug under the rock with the spoon. Then he tried to pull it towards him with the towel, but it was too heavy.Then @entity0, the lamb, started pushing the rock with her forehead. At first, the rock only rolled around in its hole. Then, when @entity1 pulled and @entity0 pushed at the same time, it rolled downhill."Thank you, @entity0," @entity1 said. "I could not have done it without you."@entity1 and @entity0 looked where the rock had been. In the middle of the circle of dirt, they saw a little cave with some baby bunnies in it. The bunnies looked hungry, and were crying for food. @entity1 went back home and told @entity2, and she gave the bunnies some lettuce.
