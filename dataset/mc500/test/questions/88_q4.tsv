There once was a spider name @entity0.  @entity0 lived in @entity2.  @entity0 was traveling to see his grandmother.  His grandmother did not live in @entity2.  She lived in @entity1.  @entity1 was far from @entity0's house, so he had to take a train.  He bought a ticket for the train ride.  The ticket was five dollars.  Before he got on the train, @entity0 the spider packed his bag.  He packed his blanket, two shirts, and two pairs of pants.  He did not pack any books or toys.  His grandmother had toys for him to play with.  She also had books for him to read.  @entity0 likes to read and play with toys.  @entity0 used the phone to call his grandmother to tell her he was coming to visit.  She was very excited.  @entity0 took his bag and went to the train.  At the train @entity0 looked at the snacks.  He wanted vanilla pudding.  They did not have vanilla or chocolate, so @entity0 got strawberry.  He took his bag and strawberry pudding and got on the train.
