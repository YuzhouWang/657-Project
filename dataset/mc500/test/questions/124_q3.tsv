In a big forest lived a fox named @entity2. He was having a fun morning. @entity0 had given him a cookie as a snack and it was yummy! Now he was wandering through the woods, looking for an adventure. After a little bit he came across a frog sitting on a log. They looked at each other, but did not say anything. @entity2 spoke first. "Hi there, my name is @entity2 and I'm a fox. Who are you?" The frog on the log did not answer at first. He finally said, "My name is @entity1 and I'm a frog. My brother could beat you up." @entity2 was very surprised to hear this. First, why would a frog's brother want to fight him? @entity4, how could some little frog beat him up? @entity2 told @entity1 he did not think he would want to fight his brother because he would hurt him. @entity1 jumped off the log and hopped away, shouting over his shoulder, "You're a liar! My brother can beat up anyone!" As the frog went away, @entity2 was very confused. He did not want to hurt anyone's feelings, but the frog was sad because of what @entity2 said. @entity2 also did not like to be called a liar, so he ran after the frog. He soon found out that @entity1's brother was not from the same mother. His brother was a brown bear named @entity3. After taking a good look at @entity3, @entity2 said yes, @entity3 could beat up anyone he chose. After that day all three of them became close friends.
