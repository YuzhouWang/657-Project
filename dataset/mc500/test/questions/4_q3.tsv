Once there was a beautiful fish named @entity0. @entity0 lived in the ocean. There were lots of other fish in the ocean where @entity0 lived. They played all day long. One day, a bottle floated by over the heads of @entity0 and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. "What is it?" said @entity0's friend @entity1. "It looks like a bird's belly," said @entity0. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it.  The bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. @entity0 could not read the note. @entity1 could not read the note. They took the note to @entity0's papa. "What does it say?" they asked.  @entity0's papa read the note. He told @entity0 and @entity1, "This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her." And that is what they did.
