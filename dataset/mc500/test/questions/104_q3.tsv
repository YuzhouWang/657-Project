A lamb named @entity1 woke up on an early Monday morning. After taking a shower and getting dressed, she chose to start making something to eat. In the end, she made eggs, toast and coffee for her breakfast. While she was eating, she was called on the telephone by her good friend @entity0 the dog. They chose to meet up after @entity1 finished eating so they could take a walk around the park. @entity0 also told her that their friend, Terry the turtle, would not be joining them. As soon as @entity1 finished cleaning her dishes, she heard a knock on her door - it was @entity0! She threw on her coat and went outside, so they could start their walk. In the end, they spent a few hours walking along the park's sidewalk, until ending up back near @entity1's house. "Let's do this again soon!" @entity0 said, as he wagged his tail. "Sure!" @entity1 said, as she walked back into her home. @entity1 made a light dinner, cleaned up, then chose to hop into bed. She soon fell asleep.
