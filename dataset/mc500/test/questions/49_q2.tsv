@entity2 and @entity0 went to the park. It was a nice Saturday afternoon. They both rode their bicycles to the park. @entity2 and @entity0 were hoping to use the swings, but when they showed up, the swings were being used by @entity1 and @entity3. "Can we use the swings?" @entity2 asked the two girls, hoping they were almost done."Not now," said @entity1. "We have only been here for a little bit." @entity2 was disappointed, but there were so many other things to do at the park. @entity2 and @entity0 went to the slide. Up and down they went, faster and faster, every time! It became a race, @entity2 and @entity0 ran back to the ladder as quickly as they could so they could go down again.After a half hour, the two boys were very tired from climbing the ladder and flying down the slide so quickly over and over. They went to their bikes to go back home. As they started going home, they saw @entity1 and @entity3 had left. They could use the swings before going home!
