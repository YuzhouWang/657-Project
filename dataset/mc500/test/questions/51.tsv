The birds chirped, the sun beat down on a nearby window, and the noisy sound of an alarm clock tried to let me know it was seven in the morning. Not only that, but the sound of a high pitched voice, announcing "It's here! It's here Janet, it's here!" That voice belonged to my sister, @entity1. What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond @entity3. She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas. We could barely hear him say how there was not much room for many items, but he fit it all together like every year. I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck, or a van, even joking an airplane, but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars.Truthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, @entity2 and @entity0. As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake. They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach. The ride and the actual activities were pretty fun! We went swimming, met some new families, and got a little reading in. @entity1 wanted to play in the sand, but there was a piece of metal nearby so our mother would not let her. Overall, we had a lot of fun and look forward to the next go around.
