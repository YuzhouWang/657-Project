@entity0 wants a new pet. Sometimes it is very hard trying to choose a new pet. There are so many different animals, each cuter than the last. There are cats, dogs, and goldfishes. In the end, @entity0 chose a bunny. @entity0's bunny is very cute. The bunny has snowy white fur and large black eyes. His ears are large, floppy, and grey. She named the bunny @entity2 since @entity2 loves to eat everything. @entity2 eats carrots, celery, and even licks @entity0's fingers! Nothing to worry, @entity2s has a very small mouth and he is never fussy. Except...every time @entity0 leans down to kiss @entity2 - he runs away! Why? @entity2 thinks @entity0 is trying to steal his treats! He hates sharing his treats. @entity2 always wants second helpings of food. @entity0 is afraid @entity2 would get so big he could fall off her lap. But not to worry @entity0, @entity2 hops around the house a lot. @entity2 knows how to stay fit like @entity0. It's clear as day! @entity0 and @entity2 make great friends.
