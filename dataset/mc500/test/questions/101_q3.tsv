@entity0 and the Big Yellow Dog@entity0 was very happy.  It was a bright, sunny day and @entity1 was taking her to @entity0's favorite place.  @entity0 loved the play park near the water!    @entity1 parked the car and @entity0 ran out right away and climbed the big slide.  Up she went and then down.  Two other kids saw @entity0 and ran over and slid down, too.  @entity0 was laughing and happy.Suddenly a big, yellow dog walked into the park.  This was really a friendly dog, and only wanted someone to play with.  But @entity0 was scared of dogs.@entity0 did not see the dog at first.  @entity0 started walking toward the swing, and the dog followed @entity0.  Before @entity0 sat on the on the swing, she turned around and saw the dog smiling at her.  The dog looked goofy standing there with its mouth open.@entity0 was scared.  She started yelling and screaming.  This only made the dog look confused.  The dog then began sounding out with @entity0, barking and howling itself.  They were a sight to see with @entity0 screaming and the dog howling.@entity1 went over and took @entity0 away from the dog, but mommy could barely keep herself from laughing.  The dog's master came and got the dog, and @entity0 went back to playing.  "Some dogs are nice," @entity1 told @entity0.
