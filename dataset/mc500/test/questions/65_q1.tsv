Dr. @entity1 On a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named @entity1. @entity1 was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday. He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family's farm. @entity1 liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat. He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick. Once, @entity1 stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony. The animal doctor was there too, and @entity1 watched everything that he did. The doctor had to keep giving @entity2 the pony some medicine. And he kept checking her eyes and mouth. When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home. But @entity1 and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside. @entity1 had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed. @entity1 was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen did not wake him up. Later, his father came and woke him. "@entity2 is going to be alright," he said to @entity1. "Really?" the boy said as he rubbed his eyes, "I got to go check on her."  "That can wait. Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, @entity0 sleepy head," his father said as he smiled at @entity1. @entity1 washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn. He stood on a stool and looked into @entity2's eyes and mouth. He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart. Then he checked her legs and tail. He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more. @entity1 saw his father standing at the door and said, "Everything looks okay, daddy. I think she can go out to the big tree with the other horses." "Okay, Dr. @entity1," his dad said as he patted @entity1 on the back. "Let's take her outside."
