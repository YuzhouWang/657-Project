@entity0 was a pig. @entity0's aunt @entity1 always took care of @entity0. All @entity0 had to do was make an oink and @entity1 would come running to check on @entity0. Sometimes @entity0 got into fights with his brother @entity3 and @entity1 always took @entity0's side. One time @entity0 accidentally lit a bush on fire when he was playing with a looking glass and the bush burned to the ground. @entity1 was very mad and @entity0 blamed it on @entity3. @entity1 believed @entity0, because she thought @entity3 was a trouble maker. One time @entity1 took a trip to the ocean and she took @entity0, but not @entity3. @entity3 was very upset, but acted like he did not want to go. @entity3 said he would rather go to the forest, the moon or the mountains, but never would he go to the ocean. This was not true, but @entity3 did not want to let @entity0 and @entity1 know that they hurt him. When @entity1 and @entity3 went to the ocean, their uncle @entity2 came to visit and to take care of @entity3. @entity3 had never met @entity2 before. @entity2 loved @entity3 and made him feel very special. When @entity1 and @entity3 came home @entity2 left and @entity3 went to live with him. They went to the ocean together; the mountains, the forest and @entity2 even took @entity3 to the moon. @entity3 was happy, because he got to see things that @entity0 never got to see. They lived happily ever after.
