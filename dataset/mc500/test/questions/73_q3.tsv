There was once a frog who lived all the way in the @entity3. His name was @entity0. He worked at @entity2's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He did not like making cake much. In fact, @entity0's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, @entity0 snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! @entity0 was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog. That is, until one elf, named @entity1, saw that there was something weird about @entity0. He did not look like the rest of the elves. So he kept his eye on @entity0, waiting to see what his secret was. One day, @entity0 slipped, and his hat fell off. When this happened, @entity1 saw that he was a frog, and not an elf! He told @entity0 that he would tell @entity2 all about how he had snuck in. @entity0 begged @entity1 not to tell. @entity1 wanted to know what was in it for him, so @entity0 promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting. @entity1 never told.
