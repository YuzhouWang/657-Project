@entity0 went out her back door and put on her sunglasses, large hat and heavy cloth work gloves.  She knelt in front of her small garden and started to pull weeds, throwing each in a small trashcan nearby.  As she worked she listened to the sounds of her neighbor's boys, @entity2 and @entity1, playing. Sometimes she stopped long enough to sip from her bottle of water.Her work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.  She chose to do laundry so she could sit and read as the washer and dryer ran.  Eventually the laundry was finished washing and drying, so she folded the laundry and put it away.She marked the chores she had completed her to-do list, then it was time for dinner.  First she filled the food bowl of her pet cat, @entity3, then she heated up some leftover lemon-garlic chicken saved from earlier in the week.After dinner she made her bed with fresh sheets from the laundry she did earlier, finished reading her book, put on her pajamas, brushed her teeth, and went to sleep.Overall, it had been a quiet but good day for @entity0, and she fell asleep feeling happy.
