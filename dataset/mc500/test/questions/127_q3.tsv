@entity2 was very excited about @entity1. She wanted to dress up as a beautiful princess. Her brother @entity0 wanted to be a zebra. Their mother made their costumes and got them ready to go trick-or-treating. The three of them walked through their neighborhood and saw all of the other children in their costumes. They saw their friends @entity3 and her sister Melissa. @entity3 was dressed as a princess, like @entity2. The two girls said hello and looked over each other's costumes. @entity2 had a purple dress with a pink hat; @entity3 had a pink dress with a purple hat. The two girls switched hats so their hats matched their costumes. They said goodbye and went on trick-or-treating.  @entity0 and @entity2 walked up to the first house on their block and rang the doorbell. A large man dressed as a doggy opened the door and gave them a bunch of candy. They thanked him and moved on. The next house had a mummy standing on the front porch. They knew it was a costume, but they were too afraid to go up to him and ask for candy, so they moved on to the next house. After they had walked the whole neighborhood and filled their bags with candy, @entity2 and @entity0 went home with their mother. They dumped the candy out on the dining room table and began to eat it. "You had a nice @entity1, did not you?" their mother asked them. @entity0 and @entity2 smiled and said yes, they had.
