The kitchen comes alive at night in the @entity3 house. Vegetables, fruit, bread, and more come out to play. The knives and forks dance on the tables. There are games and prizes. @entity7 is used for swimming races. The cereal often wins those. @entity4 gets used as balls in some games. Blueberries scream in joy as they are kicked into soccer goals in games between the spoons and vegetables like celery and carrots. Their cousins, the raspberries, like to watch the games. @entity0 has a great time and laughs. They are happy to come out and be friends. If someone, like little @entity6 or his sister @entity5, comes down to get water, they all hide until they leave. The father, @entity2, sometimes wakes up and thinks he hears something downstairs. His wife, @entity1, tells him he needs to go back to bed. She tells him he is imagining things. He is not. The kitchen got too loud. They were having so much fun they woke up the family!
