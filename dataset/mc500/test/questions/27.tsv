There once was a beautiful, brown puppy who loved her life.  Her name was @entity2.  Every morning, @entity5 brushed out her fur and feeds @entity2 her favorite breakfast.  One Tuesday morning, @entity5 had an early errand and forgot all about @entity2.  @entity2 was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside.  As she was playing with her favorite ball, @entity2 saw an opening in the fence.  Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.  She had never been on the street by herself before.  @entity2 ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.  She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.  All of a sudden, @entity2 was picked up by @entity1 and @entity0, and thrown into a truck.  She was lost and confused.  Poor @entity2 did not know what to do!  The truck pulled up to a building with a big sign that said "Animal Control".  @entity2 knew this was the place that people keep animals who are lost on the street.  Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage.  She was scared that @entity5 would not know where to find her, but she knew @entity5's phone number was on her collar.  She barked and barked to get the worker's attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.  After two long hours, a tall man, named @entity4, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.  He smiled at @entity2 and gave her a pat on the head.  @entity5 was there quickly, and gave @entity2 a big hug.  She was so happy to see her puppy again.@entity2 learned to never escape the backyard again and lived happily ever after with @entity5.
