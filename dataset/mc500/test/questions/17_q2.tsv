@entity8 and his friends wanted to join the school's @entity7 show. He asked his friends at school what would be a good idea for the @entity7 show. They came up with lots of ideas but had trouble choosing which idea to use. One person wanted to do a dance show. Another person wanted to put on a play. So @entity8 told everyone to write their idea down on a piece of paper. Then he took everyone's idea, put it into a hat, mixed them up, and picked one idea. He read the idea out loud to his friends. It said, "musical". So @entity8 and his friends were going to put on a musical. The first thing @entity8 did was give each of his friends a different job. @entity5, @entity4, and @entity6 would be the singers in the show. @entity2 and @entity1 would set up the stage and the lights. @entity3 and @entity0 would make the costumes. Later, @entity8 wanted more singers so he added @entity1 and @entity3 as singers. On the day of the school @entity7 show, the school loved the musical and cheered for @entity8 and his friends when it ended. @entity8 and his friends celebrated by going out for ice cream. The ice cream shop was all out of @entity8's favorite flavor, strawberry, so @entity8 chose to get chocolate ice cream instead.
