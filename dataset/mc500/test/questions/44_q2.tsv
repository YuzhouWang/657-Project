@entity0 was very upset. He had been looking all over his room for his library book. He could not find it at all! His dog @entity1 was trying to help, but she was only getting in the way. Today was going to be a very important library day at school. Every class that brought all of their library books back today was going to have a pizza party. If he could not find this book his class would not get a party. This was not going to be good.  @entity0 called for his dad. He was going to need help finding this book if he was going to get to school on time. His father told him that he needs to take better care of his things. He told him that he would help him find his book.  They looked in every room of the house together. They checked the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. Finally his father had an idea. He moved the couch and there was the book! @entity0 was very happy. He would help his class get a pizza party.
