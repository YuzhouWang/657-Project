@entity1 was in his bedroom. He was reading a book that his teacher gave him. The book was titled, "Everything You'd Want to Know About @entity0." He was reading the book because he was interested in learning more about fish. @entity1 thought reading the book was fun. He liked to imagine himself swimming with fish he read about in the book. Also, he liked looking at the pictures.@entity1's mother called him. @entity1 closed the book, and went downstairs. He asked his mother, "Do you need something?"And his mother said, "@entity1, it's time for dinner."
