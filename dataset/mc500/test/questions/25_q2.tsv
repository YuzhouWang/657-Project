A naughty boy was sitting in math class on Tuesday. There was a broken sink in the back of the room full of water. There was also a kitty on the open window. A loud plane was flying outside and scared the kitty inside. The naughty boy walked up to the kitty and picked it up. What do you think he did next? He threw the kitty into the water in the sink! The kitty did not last long and ran away from the sink faster than lightning! The other children laughed and laughed, but the teacher did not think it was funny. She did not let the naughty boy play on the playground for a week! But the boy did not care. The class thought he was funny, and so did he. But he would have to get smarter because the sink was fixed soon. The naughty boy thought the teacher was a witch who used a magic kiss to fix it. He had no idea that her husband fixed it the next day.
