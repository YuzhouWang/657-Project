@entity2 sat down for dinner with his Mother, who was Forty, and @entity1, who was Forty Five and Sister as he always did when it was time to eat. He always sat across from his sister, @entity4. @entity0's dinner was meatloaf, mashed potatoes with butter, and green peas. @entity2's mother made the best meatloaf. She said that her mother used the same recipe. Similar recipes were made by her friend, her aunt, and sister. But the one @entity2's mom used was the best.@entity4 was Seven years old, and @entity2 was Ten. @entity4 waited until she did not think @entity3 and dad were looking and stuck her tongue out at @entity2. What @entity4 did not know was that her mom had seen her and told her that it was not polite. "But mom! I was only playing!" @entity4 said. "No 'buts', young lady!" @entity3 said. @entity2 shook his head as he took a bite of mashed potatoes.
