One day, a boy named @entity0 went to the doctor because he fell and hurt his knee. He was riding his green tricycle in the yard when it happened. He played with yellow and red blocks in the waiting room before his visit with the doctor. His mother was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine and talking to other mothers sitting around her. The friendly nurse called @entity0 from the waiting room to finally visit the doctor. The nurse weighed @entity0, measured his height, and asked him questions about the foods he had eaten that day. The nurse also took his temperature to make sure that he did not have a fever. After the nurse left the room, the doctor came in and asked @entity0 about his knee. @entity0 told the doctor all about his fall off the tricycle and the doctor wrote a lot of notes down. Doctors write a lot of notes so they can tell people like @entity0 more about their accidents. The doctor said, "Wow @entity0! It sounds like you had quite a fall." The doctor put a bandage on his knee and gave him some medicine to take once he got home. On the way out of the doctor's office, @entity0 took a purple lollipop to eat on the car ride home. @entity0's mom drove him back home, telling him to be careful for the next time that he plays outside. @entity0's mom really cared about him and did not like to see him get hurt.
