A cat was watching a bird in a tree. The blue bird watched the cat as it tried to use its claws and climb up the tree. The cat reached the right branch and slowly walked towards the bird. The bird flew away and the cat was left stuck on the branch. The cat jumped down from the tall branch and did not get hurt. He then chased after a chipmunk along the ground. The chipmunk was not faster than the cat, but the chipmunk ran up a tree. The cat tried to run up the tree, but fell back down. Not wanting to go back up a tree, the cat watched the chipmunk from the ground. It went into a hole in the tree and the cat gave up. The cat went under a house's deck to keep cool. It watched for more birds or chipmunks that it could chase after. He saw one chipmunk in the distance, then two three and four. He was ready to chase them.
