Once there was a white horse named @entity0, who lived in a house with his best friend. His friend was a cat named @entity1 who loved to play baseball. The two of them would go to the park and play baseball with @entity2 a lamb who lived next door.  It was Friday morning and @entity0 and @entity1 were in the park waiting for @entity2. She was late and when she finally showed up she had forgotten the ball.  "What can we use for a ball?" @entity0 asked.  They looked around. There were rocks but they were too hard. There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat. Finally @entity0, being the tallest, saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing.  "Let's use a melon," @entity0 said. "That's stupid," said @entity1, the practical one. "No hear him out," said @entity2. "It might work. "It'll work," said @entity0, and he picked a melon and handed it to @entity1. "You pitch." "This is going to end badly, I'm afraid," @entity1 said, throwing the melon at @entity0 who stood over home plate. "I know what I'm doing," @entity0 said, swinging the bat as hard as he could. When the bat hit the melon it splatted into a million pieces, raining sticky pieces down on @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 and a wedding party that had been setting up nearby.  "Oops," said @entity0.
