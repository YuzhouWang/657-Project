@entity0 woke up on Monday morning. He yawned and stretched and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. When he got there he brushed his teeth and combed his hair. He went to the kitchen, where he poured some milk into his favorite green bowl and added some cereal. After he finished eating, he went back up to his bedroom to choose his clothes for the day. He put on a red T-shirt and blue jeans, and some funny blue-and-yellow socks. He looked in the mirror and smiled. It was going to be a good day. @entity0 thought he would go for a walk. He opened his door and went outside. The sun was shining and he could hear the bluebirds in the trees. @entity0 started to whistle a happy song as he made his way down the street. He counted the cars that passed by. Along the way he saw his friend Lisa, and waved to her. She waved back, and came over. "Hi @entity0," she said. "Do you want to go to the lake today?" @entity0 smiled. "Yeah!" he said, "let me go home and get my things." So @entity0 turned right around and went back home.
