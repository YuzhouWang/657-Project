There was once a baseball player who lived in a faraway land. The @entity1 players name is @entity0. @entity0 was very cool and had a lot of friends. @entity0 could throw a baseball in many different ways. His favorite way to throw it was fast. Other people liked to throw it slow, some people liked to throw it on their head, and some people even rolled it on the ground. Not @entity0, whenever he picked up a baseball he threw it very fast. People from all over the world came to see @entity0 throw the baseball. He met a guy named @entity3, who liked him a lot. @entity3 made a lot of people, like his friends Lucy and @entity2, give @entity0 things for being good at baseball. @entity0 was so good at baseball people gave him a big house.
