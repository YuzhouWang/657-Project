There was once a little boy named @entity0, who owned a dog named @entity1. One day, @entity0 was taking @entity1 outside to play. He picked up her favorite toy frog. When he did, he hit his elbow on the table. Ouch! He rubbed his elbow and frowned. Then he put his shoes on his feet, washed his hands, put on a jacket.@entity0 felt better, and went to open the door to the back yard. He walked outside. Once he got outside, he felt the cool breeze and the warm sun. They made him feel sleepy. He thought he would take a nap outside on the deck. He pushed two chairs together to make a bed. He climbed up and lay down. He used @entity1's toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. @entity1 curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too. While @entity0 and @entity1 slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too. The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table.@entity0's mother looked out the window and saw @entity0, @entity1, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping. "What a peaceful group," she thought. And then she yawned and said, "Now I am feeling sleepy too!"
