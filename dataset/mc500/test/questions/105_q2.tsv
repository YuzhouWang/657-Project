Once upon a time there was a small boy named @entity0. @entity0 was very shy and did not have a lot of friends. One day, when he was sitting outside his house, he saw a small cat hiding around his house. The cat was under his porch. This cat was yellow. @entity1 was @entity0's favorite color. @entity0 went under the porch and caught the yellow cat. @entity0 was very happy when he caught the cat. A new cat meant he had a new friend to play with. @entity0 and the cat played every day. @entity0 loved his cat and they ran happily around the neighborhood. They played in his friend's front yard, in the street, and even by the garbage can. @entity0 loved his cat and the yellow cat loved @entity0. The cat lived with @entity0, along with his orange and black cat. @entity0 had lots of cats and he wants to get a blue cat. @entity0's cats were his best friends and he was their favorite person.
