One sunny day, @entity1 and @entity0 went to the park to play. @entity1 was eating her sandwich and saw @entity0 was swinging with @entity2. @entity2 and @entity0 have been friends for Three years and love to play together with @entity1. @entity1 then made @entity0 and @entity2 a sandwich and called them both over to eat. @entity2 grabbed one and took a bite. @entity0 did not eat her sandwich, she only ate the chips. @entity1 asked if they wanted to go play on the slide and they all did. @entity2 went down the slide first. @entity0 was scared because the slide was too high up. @entity2 told @entity0 that if @entity1 can go down the slide, she can too. They both watched @entity1 go down the slide with no problem. @entity0 went up the slide and closed her eyes. When she opened them, she was at the bottom of the slide. @entity0 had done it and @entity1 and @entity2 were cheering for her! @entity0 was very happy that she went down the slide. Since @entity0 went down the slide, everyone had a cupcake.
