@entity1 and @entity0 were having lunch in the park with their mother. She had made them a picnic lunch, including sandwiches, fruit and potato chips. As they looked around the park, they watched the other families play and eat lunch. There was one family that had Three dogs with them. The dogs were chasing each other and playing Frisbee with their people. Another family had a big blanket set out and were watching their baby learn to crawl on his tummy. @entity0 asked his sister if she wanted the rest of his potato chips. @entity1 said no, that she was full. They got up and went over to the family with the dogs. The white dog jumped on @entity1 and licked her face, knocking her down. The brown dog wagged his tail and sniffed @entity0. The black dog was shy and went to sit with his family. After they said goodbye to the dogs, @entity1 and @entity0 saw their friends @entity2 and @entity3 across the park. They asked their mom if they could go play with them and she said yes. They ran to their friends and told them about the dogs they had met. @entity2 and @entity3's mom gave @entity1 and @entity0 some strawberry ice cream for dessert. They thanked her, and when they finished, they went back to their mom, ready to go home and take a nap.
