The second grade students at @entity4 were going to put on a bake sale. They wanted to raise enough money to take a field trip to the zoo. They invited all of the other students and teachers. They also invited the principal and their parents to come! They were going to have the bake sale on Friday afternoon. Today was Monday, so they only had four days to get everything together! First, @entity5, the principal, bought the tables and chairs for the bake sale. Next, @entity2, the second grade teacher, bought plates and forks and spoons. But @entity2 forgot to buy the napkins! One of the other second grade teachers ended up buying napkins along with cups for milk and juice. On Friday, all of the students brought in their baked goods and drinks. @entity3 brought chocolate chip cookies. @entity1 brought brownies. @entity0 brought vanilla cupcakes. @entity6 brought lemonade and apple juice. The bake sale raised enough money for two field trips!
