It was finally summer vacation, and @entity2 was excited to go to his favorite place. He was heading to @entity0, to visit his @entity1 and @entity3. @entity2 spends every summer there, and this summer would be no different! In the mornings, @entity2 and @entity1 would plant cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots in the ground. After they would be planted, they would water and weed the garden every day. In the afternoons, @entity3 would take @entity2 out on the ocean in his sailboat which was named "Sea girl." @entity2 loved "Sea girl" and his favorite part was smelling the salty ocean air. Sometimes @entity2 and @entity3 would go to a beach and make sandcastles, or start digging until they found buried sea shells or other treasures. At night, @entity1 and @entity3 would make dinner and they would eat outside by the pool. On special nights, @entity2 got to get ice cream for dessert. A lot of times, @entity1 made dinner dishes that included the vegetables @entity2 and @entity1 were growing. It was his favorite time of year. @entity2 could not wait to leave tomorrow morning!
