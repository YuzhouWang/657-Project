@entity0 and his friend @entity1 were walking together to meet their friends @entity3 and @entity2 at the park. They sometimes played in each @entity1's backyard, but there was much more room at the park. And it was far too dangerous to play in the street. They were going to play touch football. They would sometimes played baseball and soccer, and even kickball but today the weather was perfect for football. The summer breeze almost blew @entity0's cap off. @entity0 loved summertime. He liked the fall, too, when the leaves started to turn pretty colors. But he hated winter. @entity0 did not like the snow. @entity4 was also nice. @entity1 was drinking a Pepsi, and @entity0 had a bottle of water. @entity2 and @entity3 would most likely be drinking blue or red Gatorade at the park where they waited.
