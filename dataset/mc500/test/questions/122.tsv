My name is @entity2. Let me tell you the story of the best meal I ever had.I was sitting on the school bench outside @entity3, waiting to pick up my granddaughter. She is a real cutie, and I am very proud of her grades. To pass the time, I played my triangle. In my youth, I was a triangle player in a large @entity1 band, the @entity0s. We all wore full black costumes every time we played."What lovely triangle music! You make me think of a friend I had once upon a time." A strange lady, about my age, was standing next to me, talking!  She was holding a trumpet. It turns out the strange lady was my old friend and @entity0 trumpet player @entity6. We had not seen each other since @entity1. @entity6 told me she wanted to keep in touch, but could not remember what I looked like! We found out that all we remembered were the black costumes we always wore! It turns out; @entity6 was also there to pick someone up from school."Well, @entity2, why do not you join me and my grandson for lunch? There is a lovely @entity5 place right down the road.'We went there with my granddaughter and her grandson, and had a delicious meal. Our grandchildren got married Fifteen years later.
