Animals love to walk near the train tracks. One night a beautiful black cat was walking along the train tracks looking for a nice mouse to eat. He came across some friends, @entity1 the cat and @entity0 the dog. They chose to go looking for food together. They walked up and down the tracks looking for a wonderful meal to snack on, when they happened across a big huge melon. @entity1 asked the black cat if he like melons, the cat did not like melons. @entity1 asked the dog if he liked melons, @entity0 did not like melons either. @entity1 then ate the melon himself as they looked around for that tasty treat. They heard bells from the train coming by and then they finally saw the food they were looking for jump from the bushes over the tracks and run straight into the barn nearby. The black cat wanted to eat the mouse, so he chased him into the barn. Minutes later the black cat returned with his meal in his mouth to share with his friends.
