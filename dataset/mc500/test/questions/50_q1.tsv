It was almost @entity2's birthday and @entity3. @entity2 wanted to paint pumpkins at the circus, but she was sick in bed. She had broken her leg earlier and now all of her leg hurt, even her toes. She had hurried when she had crossed the road, and slipped and ended up going to the hospital. Because she was not being careful enough, she was stuck in bed, eating crackers and watching television. Just as @entity2 was on her fourth hour of television, her mother knocked on her door. "@entity2," she said. "Your friends are here." @entity2 looked up to see her two best friends, @entity0 and @entity1. They were grinning. "@entity2," @entity0 said, "We got you something." When they entered, @entity2 saw that they had a giant pumpkin with them. @entity1 was carrying a set of paints and paintbrushes. "Aww," @entity2 said. "Thank you, guys." "Duh," @entity0 said. "What are friends for?"
