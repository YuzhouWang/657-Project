Once upon a time, there lived a @entity0 bird. This was a very normal bird. It did not sing pretty songs.   It did not have colorful feathers but it did have thing that made it stand out from the other birds. It had a very long tail feather.  And with this long tail feather, the bird could do wonderful tricks. He could fly in circles and fly at super-fast speed.  @entity0 bird lived on a quiet street, at a yellow house.  Its nest was on top of a basketball pole that the kids who lived in the yellow house had outgrown.  The bird was a daddy bird and had two baby birds in its nest.  One of the baby birds had a long tail feather like the daddy bird.  The other baby bird did not.  Instead, it had wings with many colors like the mommy bird.  This bird family lived at the yellow house all summer long.  The mommy and daddy birds came back for many summers and had many more baby birds but only one, the very first baby bird, had a long tail feather and could do tricks like daddy bird.
