Once, there was a boy named @entity1 that was no older then seven or eight years old.  @entity1 lived with his mother Sam and father Spike in a small house in a dangerous neighborhood in @entity2 city.  Before their move from Florida he spent most of his time outside at a park. In fact they moved around a lot.  They have also lived in @entity3 and @entity0 and this was the first time being stuck inside. It got so bad he was looking forward to going to school. This boy was an only child and was not allowed to go outside to play.  Instead he spent most of his time locked inside his house alone with no friends to play with.  One day he got a great idea.  Why do not I ask my mom, for a pet?  He thought long and hard.  I can get a dog or cat. I do not like birds, fish or hamsters. This way I'll always have a friend to play with when I'm inside.  He thinks to run up to his mom and say mommy, mommy!  Can I get a new pet?  His mom told him that if he wanted a pet that he would have to show her that he could take care of it.  She gave him chores and said, "if you can do these chores for one month I'll get you a dog."  Every evening before bed he would clear the table, clean the bathrooms and nicely stack all of the dishes.  His mother was in awe in the fact the she never had to tell him to complete his chore.  At the end of the month his mother kept her promise a got him a new puppy.  The boy was in love at first sight but the boy was not sure if the puppy looked like a Bob or a @entity4.  Finally he yelled,  "I'm going to call him @entity4!"
