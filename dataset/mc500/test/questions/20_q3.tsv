When it is the end of school and the weather is warmer, that is a beautiful time called summer. @entity0 is wonderful because there are so many amazing things to do! You can wear fun dresses and get dirty playing outside, or you can stay inside all day and watch television. You can also ride your bike, meet up with friends during any time of the day, or maybe even eat ice-cream for breakfast! I have a birthday during the warmer summer weather and sometimes it is hard to get all my friends together at my home for cake and presents because they are on vacation! When I see my friends at school later they wish me happy birthday. My friends like me, but sometimes it is not so easy to get together. That's a stinker when that happens. It's a good thing that I have a pig named @entity1 to be my friend during those times! I also have other friends, like a cat and a dog, but @entity1 is the best. He's a stinker sometimes, but he's got cute little oinks to help me to know what he needs. He's also very sweet, caring, and he's always ready to listen. He's a wonderful friend.
