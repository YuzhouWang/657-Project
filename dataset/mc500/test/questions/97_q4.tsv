@entity0 was a strange boy. He liked to eat anything that was put in front of him, even if it was not food. As a child he ate chalk sticks thinking it was candy. All the strange things he ate made him very sick. After eating the chalk, his stomach made a weird noise as if it was trying to talk to him. @entity0 accidentally pooped on the door mat because he did not make it to the bathroom in time, but he still did not stop eating strange things.  One day, @entity0 got in trouble at the zoo for trying to eat lettuce along with the big cats. His parents felt that they needed to help @entity0 fix his problem. His dad had a great idea, and he needed one month to do it. One month later, his dad took off his sock and put it in front of @entity0. @entity0 immediately ate the sock like he always did, but something special happened. @entity0 saw bright lights and passed out. It turns out that @entity0's dad did not change his sock or wash his toes for the whole month. The stink was so powerful that it got magical. The magical stink changed @entity0's mouth, brain, and stomach to help him tell the difference between real food and things that were not food. @entity0 started to eat like a normal child and he lived a good life.
