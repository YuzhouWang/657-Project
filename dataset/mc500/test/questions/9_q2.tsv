He tells them to eat lettuce every time that he sees them, so that they grow big and strong like he is. @entity4 likes to add some sugar with the lettuce so that @entity1 and @entity3 know what it is like to have sweet tastes in their life. One day, a Wednesday, @entity1 throws some lettuce into @entity3's hair. @entity4 laughs an grabs some straw from their farm and puts it in @entity1's hair. @entity1 and @entity3 live on a farm. They have a goat, named @entity5, and a duck, named @entity0. They sometimes play a game with the goat where they chase him around the farm.
