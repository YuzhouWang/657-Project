All of @entity2's friends have a favorite animal. @entity0's favorite animal is the bear. @entity1's favorite animal is the monkey. @entity3's favorite animal is the rabbit. But @entity2's favorite animal is the panda. The only problem is that @entity2 has never seen a panda. In fact, none of @entity2's friends have seen one. One time, @entity2 and his friends went to the zoo. There were many animals at the zoo, and everyone was very excited to them. There were monkeys, bears, and even rabbits. When they went to see the monkeys, @entity1 even handed one of the monkeys a banana and the monkey ate it. But there was no panda. @entity4 started to think there was no such thing as a panda. If @entity2 was going to see a panda, he would have find one himself. He packed up his backpack with sandwiches, a chocolate bar, and some water and he went out into the forest. He knew that a panda's favorite food was leaves, so made sure to pack some leaves in his backpack too. He spent two week in the forest looking everywhere for a panda. Finally, when has about to give up, he saw a family of pandas eating and playing. He gave them all the leaves in his backpack. He sat watching them for the rest of the day. He watched pandas bathe and climb trees. Then he went home and went to sleep.
