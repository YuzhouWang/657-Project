One day @entity0 was walking in the park. Suddenly a kitten came up to her and meowed. It reached up and put its feet on @entity0's leg. It was so friendly! But the kitten was very skinny. Its ribs were showing and the sides of its belly were almost touching. It had no collar.@entity0 thought that the kitten must not have a home. She brought the kitten home with her. She looked on the Internet to see if it matched a lost kitten ad. But none of the missing kittens looked like her kitten. @entity0 took the kitten to the doctor to see if there was an ID chip under the skin. The doctor looked at the kitten with a machine but there was no chip. So @entity0 knew this really was a kitten without a home. She knew she would have enough money to pay for the kitten's food and care. She knew she could make enough time to play with the kitten too keep it happy. She paid the doctor to give the kitten its shots. She brought it back home and gave it food and toys. @entity0 and the kitten lived happily together for years.
