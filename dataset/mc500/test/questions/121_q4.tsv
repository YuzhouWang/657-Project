She liked many kinds of ice cream, but her favorite was strawberry.  She liked it best because it was pink, and pink was her favorite color.  Because she liked eating ice cream so much, she wanted a kingdom wide ice cream eating holiday.  @entity1 had to stop working and eat ice cream.  All of the people were happy with the new holiday.  It was summer, and everyone would rather eat ice cream than work.  The queen wanted to see what the favorite flavor of ice cream was in her kingdom.  @entity1 got to say their favorite flavor.  One hundred and @entity2 people liked chocolate.  @entity0 people liked vanilla.  Three hundred and Eighty Two people liked strawberry.  The queen was very happy that everyone liked strawberry as much as she did.  The king was not happy.  He liked chocolate the best.
