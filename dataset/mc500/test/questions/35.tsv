Today was the @entity2's birthday, and Ms. @entity0 wanted to be sure to get the best gift ever for her friend @entity2. She had no idea what she was going to get him! A rainbow sounded like a fun gift, but everyone has a rainbow, and she was sure that @entity2 had one too.Ms. @entity0 looked all around space for the right gift for @entity2. She asked @entity5 was she was going to get @entity2. "Oh, I think I'm going to get @entity2 a space puppy. He was talking about how much he loved dogs!" That sounded like such a good idea to Ms. @entity0, but since @entity5 was going to get a space puppy, that meant that Ms. @entity0 could not do it too!"Try asking @entity4." said @entity5. "He might know what to get @entity2."Ms. @entity0 asked @entity4. "Well," said @entity4. "I know that I'm getting @entity2 a space ship, and that @entity1, @entity3 and Pluto are going together to get @entity2 a new house.""Wow!" said Ms. @entity0. "How am I ever going to get @entity2 something as nice as a house, or a space ship, or a space puppy?"@entity4 thought about it for a little bit. "Hmm." he said. "Maybe you could make him something?""What a great idea!" said Ms. @entity0. "I know what would be perfect to make for him!"That night, at @entity2's birthday party, when @entity2 opened the gift from Ms. @entity0, he was the happiest he had been about any of the gifts. "It's the perfect gift! Thank you so much Ms. @entity0!" He pulled out of the box a beautiful sweater that Ms. @entity0 had made out of her own star dust. "It's so cold here in space! A sweater is the best gift ever!"
