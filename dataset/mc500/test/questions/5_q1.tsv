@entity0 was sad. He was playing in the school yard at recess and a girl in his class was being mean to him. Her name was @entity2. @entity2 was best friends with @entity1. @entity1 was nice to @entity0, but @entity2 kept being mean. @entity2 kicked dirt at @entity0 and called him mean names. @entity1 felt bad that her friend was so nasty to @entity0. @entity0 knew that @entity2 did not like him, so he sat down in the school yard with a big frown. All of a sudden, a stranger walked up to @entity0 and asked him if he wanted some rock sugar candy. He told @entity0 he had lots of sugar rock candy in his car in the parking lot. @entity0 remembered his parents telling him never to talk to strangers, so he started running away from the man. @entity2 and @entity1 were on the jungle gym and they saw @entity0 running from the stranger. They went to tell their teacher, Mrs. Mustard, who was still inside the classroom. @entity2 and @entity1 came into the classroom screaming for help. @entity0 ran into the classroom right after the girls. Mrs. Mustard looked out into the recess yard, but the stranger was gone. @entity3, Mrs. Mustard's helper, called the police to report what had happened.
