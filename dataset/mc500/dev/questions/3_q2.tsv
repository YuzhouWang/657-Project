There once lived an elf who was a stinker.  He was real mean to everyone around.  He'd throw pies at girls.  He'd put soap in the fridge.  He'd give the queen shorts as birthday presents.  No one liked the elf.  One day he was planning a way to make someone feel sad.  He thought to draw on someone's head.  He went looking for someone who was asleep so he could draw on them.  He found a boy laying under a tree.  He walked right up to him with his magic marker.  He drew a giant house on the boy's forehead.  The boy woke up and pushed the elf off of him.  The boy knew the elf had done something bad to him so he ran all the way home without looking back.  The elf felt real good about himself.  He had mad the boy sad!  He skipped off and took a swim in a nearby pond.  The boy never talked to the elf again after that.  The elf did not care and went on annoying people.
