@entity1 and @entity0 chose to meet at the park on Saturday to play ball and have a picnic. They went to the same grade school together and lived on the same street down from the park. @entity0 does not often like boys, but for a boy, @entity1 was alright. Most boys like @entity3 and @entity2 are stupid and a real pain, but @entity1 was a lot of fun to play with and did not do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess. When @entity1 and @entity0 arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that @entity1 was a monster and @entity0 was the monster hunter. @entity0 chased @entity1 all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. @entity1 ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He did not get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that @entity1's feet could dry off and so that he would not feel silly without shoes. @entity0 took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. @entity1 opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. @entity0 wanted to trade @entity1 his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together. After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds. Some clouds looked like animals or shapes. @entity1 spotted one that looked like a reindeer. @entity0 pointed to one that looked like a drum. Finally @entity1 and @entity0 got up and brushed off the grass and headed for home.
