@entity3 is an eight year old girl who lives with her parents and pet bird. One Saturday afternoon, she sits at the kitchen table. She draws a picture of her family. She makes sure to draw her mom named @entity1 wearing a purple dress, because that is her favorite. She draws many yellow feathers for her pet bird named @entity2. After she is done, she gives the picture to her mom. Her mom hangs it up on the silver refrigerator. The next day, @entity3's mom comes home with a brown dog named @entity0. She tells @entity3 that she is pet-sitting, which is like babysitting but with a friend's dog. @entity3's mom tells her she can play with the dog as long as she takes good care of him. @entity3 is excited. She pets @entity0 nicely on his soft back. He wags his tail. He barks, "Woof!" and shows he wants to play fetch with her. @entity3 giggles and throws a ball for him to catch. She wishes her bird could play like this with her every day!
