@entity0's doll, @entity1, was a magical doll. @entity0 kept @entity1 hidden from her friends, even @entity4, who was her best friend. @entity0 did not want all the other girls from school, like @entity2 and @entity3, to find out that she had a magical doll. @entity1 could do things other dolls could not. @entity0 would whisper in her ear a secret word, and all of a sudden @entity1 would come to life, hopping around, running all over. But @entity1 did more than run, she could talk. @entity0 told @entity1 everything, and @entity1 understood. One day, @entity0 was naughty and lied to her mother. @entity0's mother put @entity1 on top of the refrigerator where @entity0 could not get to her. @entity0 was very sad. The one person she told everything to was out of her reach. The next day, @entity0 had one of the worst days of her life. She needed to tell someone, but @entity4 was not around. She needed @entity1. She had no ladder, chair, or stool to reach her. @entity4 moved the kitchen table forward towards the refrigerator, and hopped on top. She started to climb up to reach for @entity1, and grabbed her quickly. She came down, dropping @entity1 on the floor, and broke @entity1. @entity0 whispered the secret word, but @entity1 did not awake. @entity1's powers were gone. She could not walk, run, talk, or listen. @entity0 hurt her the one person she could trust the most. Then, @entity1 moved, looked at @entity0, and a tear came from her eye. @entity1's eyes closed, and she was without life. She cried no more.
