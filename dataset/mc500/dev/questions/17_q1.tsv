There once was a guy named @entity11 and girl named @entity6.  They really liked spending time together.  One day, @entity11 traveled from his home in the @entity1 of @entity9 to @entity6's house in @entity3.  They then thought to take a sudden trip around the world.  They first traveled by plane around @entity0, where they saw many different people and sights.  They then took a boat to @entity4 and @entity5, where they went on a trip through the mountains.  Later in the month, they traveled to @entity7 by train and were allowed to see how different life was over there.  Next they took another plane to @entity2, where they had a lot of fun seeing kangaroos and a different type of @entity8 speaking people.  After spending a week in @entity2, @entity11 and @entity6 took a really long plane ride to North @entity9, where they drove across the land.  They saw everything from the mountains to forests.  They even got to visit the beach!  Because they had so much fun, @entity11 returned home with @entity6 to @entity3 where they hung out and spent the next few days and months talking about all of the neat things they saw and did on their trip.
