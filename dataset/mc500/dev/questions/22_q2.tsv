@entity1 wanted to make a cake for his Mom's birthday. His dad was going to help him. @entity1 had eggs, milk, and flour at his house, but no sugar! @entity0 told @entity1 to take his bicycle to the store so he could buy sugar for the cake. On his way to the store, @entity1 saw his friend, @entity2, at the park. He rode over to say hello. @entity1 and @entity2 played lots of games at the park. After a long time, @entity1 saw it was starting to get dark. He needed to hurry if he was going to make it to the store and get home before night time. @entity1 rode as fast as he could, and made it to the store. The store was really big, but @entity1 found the sugar really fast. When @entity1 was on his way to the front of the store to pay for the sugar, he saw a toy he had been wanting for a long time. But @entity1 only had enough money to pay for the sugar or the toy. @entity1 did not know what to do! The cake would taste good and would make his mom happy.
