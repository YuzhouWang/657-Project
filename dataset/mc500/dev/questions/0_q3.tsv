One sunny morning, @entity0 chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived. @entity0 laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first @entity0 thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As @entity0 leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, "Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?" @entity0 was surprised and jumped to his feet. "You can talk!" he shouted. "Yes," said the bug. "Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!" @entity0 felt sad. "Gee," he cried. "That sounds terrible!"@entity0 thought about the problem. "Perhaps you can stay at my house," he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, "Oh, that would be wonderful!" The two traveled back to @entity0's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When @entity0 woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. "Thank you for letting me sleep here last night," said the butterfly. It was the bug! "I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I wo not forget your kindness." After speaking, the butterfly flew away. @entity0 stood in his doorway and shouted, "Goodbye!"
