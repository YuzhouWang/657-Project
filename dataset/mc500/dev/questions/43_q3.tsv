Once upon a time, there was a squirrel named @entity3. @entity3 loved to go outside and play with his cousin @entity1. @entity3 and @entity1 played silly games together, and were always laughing. One day, @entity3 and @entity1 went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond. @entity3 woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. He could not find anything to eat except for pie! Usually, @entity3 would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast. After he ate, he and @entity1 went to the pond. On their way there they saw their friend @entity0. They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. @entity3 and @entity1 got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and @entity1 put on his favorite purple shirt. @entity3 put on a blue shirt with red and green dots. The two squirrels ate some food that @entity3's mom, @entity2, made and went off to bed.
