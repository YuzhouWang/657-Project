@entity1 loved playing baseball. He would play every day, even if there was no practice that day! One day, @entity1 went to the park with his mom to play catch with his friends, but as he was playing, he tripped over a rock, and his shoe slipped off! His shoe went flying into the air, high up into the sky, and @entity1 watched as the shoe fell into old man @entity0's yard. What was he going to do? His mom sat on a bench not too far away, reading a book. "Should I tell Mom?" @entity1 thought to himself. He thought that maybe he should not, because he might get in trouble. Instead, he was going to climb the fence into @entity0's yard!"What, are you crazy?" @entity1's friend @entity2 said when he told him what he was going to do. @entity2 did not seem to like the idea. "@entity0 is a mean old man, and he'll yell at you for sure. I think you need to tell your mom!" With that, @entity2 ran off to tell @entity1's mom!@entity1 ran after @entity2, trying to get him to stop, but @entity2 told the whole story before @entity1 could get there. After @entity1's mom heard the story, she took @entity1 by the hand and said, "Come on, @entity1, let's go get your shoe!" @entity1 was worried. What was she going to do?@entity1's mom took him straight to mean old @entity0's door, and knocked on it. "Oh no!" thought @entity1, "He's going to yell at me!" But the man who opened the door was a nice old man, and he smiled at little @entity1, and let them get his shoe. That's when @entity1 learned that it's always better to be honest.

@entity2 said @entity1 was crazy and...
