@entity0 loves playing with her noodle friend.  She had it for a long time so it is now a dark brown color.  When her mom first made it, it was white.  The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night.  @entity0's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night.  On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor.  To @entity0, it looked like a stick man so she kept him.  She named her new noodle friend @entity2 and took him everywhere she went.  Sometimes @entity2 gets a little dried out so @entity0's mom told her to soak him in water every few days.  There were a couple times that the family dog, @entity1, has tried to take @entity2 from @entity0 and eat him!  So from now on, @entity0 takes extra special care to make sure @entity2 is safe and sound at all times.  During the day she keeps him in a plastic bag in her pocket.  At night, she puts him under her pillow.  She loves @entity2 and wants to always be friends with him.
