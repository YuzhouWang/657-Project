Three cats named @entity3, @entity0, and @entity2 wanted to start a band. They put an ad in the newspaper because they needed a drummer. @entity3 and @entity0 would play guitar and sing. @entity1 would be played by @entity2. A few weeks passed and no one called about the ad. Finally, one afternoon the telephone rang. A deep voice said, "Do you still need a drummer?" @entity3 said, "Yes, come by this afternoon." @entity3 got the other cats together and they set up their instruments and waited for the drummer to show up. Soon a dog came running up, pulling a set of drums behind him. "You're the drummer?" @entity0 hissed. "Scram!" said @entity2. But @entity3 was more accepting. "C'mon guys, we need a drummer. Just let him play!" she said. "Okay," said @entity0 and @entity2. They started to jam. "We need to come up with a name," @entity0 said, between songs. "How about 'Atomic Death Fish?'" said @entity2. "No, too scary," said @entity0. "How about 'Monkeys on Mars?'" said @entity3. "Too goofy," said @entity0. "How about '@entity0 and the No Nos?'" said the drummer. "I love it!" everyone said.
