@entity2 and @entity1 (brother and sister) went to the playground one afternoon with their mom and dad, @entity3 and @entity0. They were playing a game of tag and having the best time ever running after each other and laughing. They liked to play tag instead of building sandcastles or swinging. They liked tag because they liked to run. They like to play hopscotch or jump rope but that day they wanted to play tag. Other games are not as fun. They met @entity4 and @entity5 (who are best friends) and invited them to play tag too. @entity4 and @entity5 like to play other games like hopscotch or jump rope but that day they joined the game of tag. Making new friends is important. @entity4 and @entity5 would rather make friends than play their favorite games.
