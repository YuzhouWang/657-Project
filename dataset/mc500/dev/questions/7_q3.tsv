@entity1 was standing on a rock.  Suddenly, she had to sneeze.  After she sneezed, she walked away.  She finally got to the park and saw her daddy.  Her daddy gave her some milk.  @entity1 drank the milk in a big hurry.  She loved milk.  She walked over and turned a switch.  She walked to the lake.  @entity1 was in a big hurry and went really fast.  She got to the lake and sat down.  @entity1 began thinking.  @entity1 wanted to go on a trip to @entity0.  @entity1 did not want to go someplace cold.  @entity1 did not want to go to the moon.  @entity1 did not want to go to @entity2.  @entity1 stood up to fold her towel.  She never folded her shirts or pants.  @entity1 would start her art for her aunt in a few hours.  She knew she would use a lot of time making that art.  Her aunt would love the art.
