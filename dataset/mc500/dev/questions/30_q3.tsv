The sun was rising in the morning and the birds were waking up. A mother bird was watching over her baby eggs in the nest. She laid four eggs yesterday, some white and some spotted. She had been keeping them warm so that her babies would soon be born. Little cracks appeared on the eggs and they started to grow and grow. Little "cheeping" sounds could be heard coming from inside, and soon the eggs cracked open. @entity1 baby birds were inside, crying for food. The mother had nothing to give, so she quickly flew to the ground and looked in the dirt for food. She saw some worms wiggling in the ground. She picked a few up with her beak and flew them up to the nest. The babies were well fed with the worms, and the mother kept them all warm in the cold spring morning. @entity0 came home to find his new babies, and they were all a happy family.
