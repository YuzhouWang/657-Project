It was a cold day when @entity0 made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.  There had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.  He put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard.  It seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot.Sure enough, he found how the crook had gotten in.  A tree, weighted down by the snow, had fallen on the fence on a windy day and broken a section.  He got out his toolbox, and with a tool, cut some sections of wire.  He used the wires to fix the fence.Now, it was time to catch the crook.  Sure enough, he saw tracks heading to and from the fence.  But they were not a crook's footprints.  It had been a raccoon that had been stealing things from his yard.
