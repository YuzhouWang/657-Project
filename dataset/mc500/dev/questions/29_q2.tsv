It was Tuesday.  Tuesday was @entity1's favorite day.  Wednesday was nice because it was always @entity2.  Saturday was great because of the morning cartoons.  But Tuesday?  Tuesday was the day it always went to visit its friend @entity0. It was a beautiful day!  The spring wind was blowing, and the sun was shining.  @entity1 and @entity0 went to play by the river.   They were having a great time.  They swam.  They fished.  They played hide and seek. Suddenly, the wind picked up. "Hey, @entity1!  Would you like to see a trick?" "Sure @entity0!  What is it?" @entity0 took a string out of its pocket.  @entity0 tied it to her, and then she tied it to a tree. "Watch this!"  @entity0 jumped into the wind.  Suddenly, she was flying!  She floated.  She swooped.  She played with the clouds and the birds.  She flew faster.  She flew slower. At first, @entity1 was amazed.  But slowly, @entity1 started to frown. @entity0 landed in front of her friend.  "What's wrong?" "That was amazing!  It looks like a lot of fun.  But I am not shaped like a kite.  I ca not do those amazing things like you." @entity0 smiled.  "Yes you can, @entity1!  @entity3 on your tip-toes!" So @entity1 did. "Now, go look at yourself in the river." @entity1 walked to the river and looked down.  But he did not see a square.  He saw a diamond! @entity0 handed @entity1 the string.  "Now jump!" she said. @entity1 jumped.  He jumped as high as he could.  Just as he started to fall, the wind blew and picked him up. He was flying, like @entity0! He floated.  He swooped.  He played with the clouds and the birds.  He flew faster.  He flew slower. He soon landed.  The sun was setting, so they said goodbye and made plans to meet again next Tuesday. It was a beautiful day.
