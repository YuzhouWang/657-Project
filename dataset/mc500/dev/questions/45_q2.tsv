It was a cold winter day in @entity0's city. It was December and snowing outside. This made @entity0 want a bowl of warm soup. @entity0 went to the refrigerator to make soup. He looked for the things needed to make the soup. He did not see some items he needed. @entity0 needed to go to the grocery store. @entity0 wanted to make a list. He found a pencil and paper to make a list. He needed sugar, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. @entity0 wrote down the items. He put the grocery list in his pocket. He then went to the closet to get dressed. @entity0 needed a jacket and gloves for the cold weather. He also put his boots on. He remembered to close the front door to his house. @entity0 used a key to lock his front door. Then he put the house key is his pocket. The grocery store was around the corner. @entity0 walked to the grocery store. He grabbed a grocery basket to put his items in. What did @entity0 need?
