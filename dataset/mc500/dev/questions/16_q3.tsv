@entity4 and his class were looking forward to a fun day in art class. The teacher gave the class paint, brushes and other items to use to make their drawings. @entity4's friend @entity3 used a straw to blow paint on his paper. It looked very cool. @entity1 used markers to make a picture of her and her dog. @entity1 has several pets, but her favorite one is her dog, @entity2. @entity0 used a potato to make stars. He then put the potato into different colors of paint and made a nice pattern. @entity4 used feathers to make his picture. When they had finished, the class chose which picture was the best. @entity4 got second place and was very excited. Then it was time for lunch and the class had a party. They had hamburgers with ketchup and had cake for dessert. It was a very fun day for the whole class. They all went home tired and happy. @entity4 took a nap when he went home.
