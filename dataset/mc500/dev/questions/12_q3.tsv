@entity1 swam around the pond. He was a duck. He was wet, but he was a duck and did not care. He ate some bugs. He saw some worms on the bottom, but was not interested in them, or in the bread crumbs, or the hot dog the boy had dropped. He kept on swimming and swimming. He was a mess. After he had eaten his food, it was afternoon. The sun was setting, and @entity1 wanted to rest in the sun, and sleep. He found a nice place to sit, and began to rest. Falling asleep quickly, he slept for a few hours. When he woke up it was dark outside. He had missed dinnertime, but there were always those worms at the bottom of the pond. @entity1 ate quickly, and was soon ready to swim more. The pond was small, not a lake, or a river or a stream. He swam around for a little longer, and soon it was ready for bed in the nest, where he slept with his family @entity0, @entity2, and @entity3. The other animals were sleeping as well, the dog and the cat on the porch. The cow was sleeping in the barn. And last the kittens in their box. @entity1 was ready for bed, it had been a long day, and the next day was going to be the same. But @entity1 did not care. He loved being a duck. @entity1 was one happy duck.
