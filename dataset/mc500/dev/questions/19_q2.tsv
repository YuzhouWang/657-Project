Princess @entity0 wanted nothing more than to be a singer when she grew up. She had a beautiful voice and everyone who heard it said she was the best singer in the land. But her uncle believed singing would keep her from her job as princess, so he found a witch and paid her to steal Princess @entity0's voice. The witch made a spell which gave @entity0 the witch's voice. The spell also gave @entity0's voice to the witch. The witch went on to become famous as a singer, and @entity0 grew up to be Queen. One day Queen @entity0 heard of a singer who was the best in the land. She went to hear this singer, and was surprised to hear her own voice coming from the woman on stage. When the show was over, @entity0 found the singer and gave her a penny.  @entity0 told the singer, "You have a magical voice". The witch was so touched by @entity0's kindness, that she gave @entity0 her voice back.
