@entity1's cat, @entity0, was missing. She was very scared. @entity1 got on her bicycle to look for her. She looked up and down the street for @entity0 and called for her, but @entity0 did not come. @entity1 went to the lake and found a turtle. "Mr. @entity2," she said. "Have you seen my cat, @entity0?""No, @entity1," said Mr. @entity2. He was very old, and did not see very well. "I can barely see my own shell." "I'm sorry," said @entity1. "But I have to find @entity0. It's almost time for her supper."She went further down the street, and met a puppy. "Hello, puppy," she said. "Have you seen my cat, @entity0?"The puppy was new, and had not met @entity0 yet. "I do not know who @entity0 is," he said. "But I'll let you know if I meet her."@entity1 thanked the puppy and looked a little more before going home. It was dark, and the stars were out. @entity1 cried, and wished upon a star. "Please let @entity0 come home safe," she wished.The star twinkled, and @entity1 heard a meow. It was @entity0' voice! @entity0 had been hiding under @entity1's bed all along! @entity0 jumped into @entity1's lap, and @entity1 hugged her and gave her her dinner, and then they went to bed and fell asleep.
