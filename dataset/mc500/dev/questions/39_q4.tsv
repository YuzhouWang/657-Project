The bird by the river chirped twice before breaking into song, to tell all the other animals to sing along. The dog barked, the other birds sang, the squirrel squeaked, and the rabbit clapped its ears together. The cat did not because his mouth was hot from some very strong mustard. He thought to himself that he would not have eaten that hot dog if he knew it was on it. He tried to look for water, but that mustard drove his nose crazy and he could not smell anything. Not even water. Luckily for the cat, cats have very good eyes, and he saw a puddle out of the corner of his eye. He ran to it. He wondered why the water was kind of yellow, and thought it must be from the leaves floating in the puddle. The cat took a big drink. It made his tongue felt so much better that it made him want to sing, but the others were done and the bird had flown away.
