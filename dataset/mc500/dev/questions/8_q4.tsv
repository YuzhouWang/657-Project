@entity0 put on her favorite dress.  She liked it because it had cats on it.  She was very excited about her birthday cake.  Maybe the cake would have a turtle on it.  @entity0 was going to have turkey.  She had no gravy, so she had chicken for dinner instead.  After eating the chicken, she remembered she was late for the dance!  She ran up the stairs.  She put on a coat and ran out the door.  She walked past some ice cream.  She did not have time to stop and eat any of the ice cream.  She walked past some sprinkles.  She did not have time to eat the sprinkles.  @entity0 walked past the yogurt.  She did not have time to get the yogurt.  @entity0 got to where she had to go.  Soon after, she turned around and started the long walk back home.  She got home at last.  She saw her huge cake.  It had chocolate on it.  @entity0 was very happy.  She was ready to enjoy the cake.
