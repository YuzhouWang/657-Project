@entity0 the cat went outside to play. First she went on the trail to the river. @entity0 sat and watched the fish. She wanted to catch a fish. The fish swam away too fast. Next she went to the field. @entity0 laid down in the grass and took a nap. There's nothing like a cat nap on a warm day. When @entity0 woke up she saw a mouse. @entity0 ran after the mouse and tried to catch it. The mouse ran into a hole and got away. "That's okay" @entity0 said. "I'll get him next time." @entity0 went back to the trail and began to walk home. When she got back to the river she took a drink of water. "This water tastes good" said @entity0. When she got back to her house, @entity0 went inside and ate a cat treat. She spent the rest of day playing with her favorite person. "This was a good day" said @entity0.
