The angel alligator was quite the sight!  It loved to scream with all its might!It loved to roll in mud and sun.  Then it would go for a run.But why did it run?  Why did it scream?  It had a fork in its butt!  It sat in a trashcan.  This was not a smart thing to do!  But he did it, oh yes, oh me, oh you!The alligator had a beard.  It was a great beard.  But nobody ever talked about his beard.  Why?  Because they would only see the fork in its butt!But one day, the alligator made a friend.  The friend needed a fork.  How was he to eat his spaghetti without a fork?  But...I'm not sure a butt fork is the best way to eat spaghetti.Do you?
