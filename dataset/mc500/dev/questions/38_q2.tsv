@entity0's parents are farmers and they have a huge farm with cows, chickens, and ducks. @entity0 loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on. One day, @entity0's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field. His father was worried that @entity0 would climb on it and hurt himself. @entity0 went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows. When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near. He knew that climbing on the tractor would not hurt anything, so he did. He climbed on to the seat and sat there. Then, he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor. @entity0's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him. @entity0 heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast. When he did that, he fell off and hurt his arm. @entity0 was in pain and his father came running to check on him and picked him up and sat him on a bench and asked him why he did that. @entity0 looked at his father and said, "I wanted to be like you." @entity0's father gave him a hug and asked him if he wanted to ride with him on the tractor. @entity0 did and after he got a bandage on his arm, he and his father rode in the field on the tractor.
