She had lots of friends at her old school. She really misses her best friend, @entity1.  When she gets to school on the first day, she feels very nervous. She wants to go back to her other school. She even misses Mrs. Bell, her first grade teacher.  Her new teacher, Mrs. Borden, makes her stand in front of the class and say something about herself. She is so embarrassed! She is told to sit between two boys, @entity4 and @entity5. When it is time for lunch, Mrs. Borden picks @entity3 to lead the line. Maybe, she's not so bad after all, @entity3 thinks.  At lunch, she meets Mrs. Stewart. Mrs. Stewart works in the school office. She is very nice. @entity3 finds a seat in the lunchroom. She smiles at the girl next to her. The girl's name is Sue. She is very nice to @entity3. She even shares a cookie with @entity3. @entity3 is very happy that she has a new friend.
