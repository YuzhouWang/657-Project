One day @entity1 took a walk to the park. The park was very close to her house. One her way to the park she passed her friend @entity2's house. @entity1 stopped by and asked if @entity2 wanted to play. @entity2 said yes. @entity1 and @entity2 walked together to the park. @entity0's house was three houses down. @entity1 and @entity2 stopped by to ask @entity0 if he wanted to play at the park. @entity0 said no. He was afraid of being chased by a squirrel. @entity1 worried that @entity0 did not like her, but @entity0 thought she was a good friend. So @entity1 and @entity2 went to the park to play. They loved the park. They loved the flowers, and the swings! Soon it was dinnertime and the girls went home. What a lovely day at the park.
