@entity2 wanted to have a birthday party for his son, @entity1. @entity2 and his wife @entity3 knew that their son loved clowns, as did their daughter Jane. So they looked up a place to have a clown come to his birthday party. When the clown arrived, ten of @entity1s friends showed up to watch the show. His parents had sent out Twelve invites, thinking Six or Eight kids would come. The clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into @entity2's face. This caused @entity2's face to turn red. After the show, when everyone had left, it was up to @entity2 and @entity3 to clean up after the party. There was food everywhere; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground. Later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat. The choices were order a pizza, make hamburgers, go get fried chicken or make noodles. Since it was @entity1's birthday they let him choose. He really wanted pizza so they called up @entity4 to place their order. When the pizza arrived it did not come in a square box like most pizzas. Instead it was in a round box that no one had ever seen. @entity2 gave everybody a slice and then placed @entity1 in his lap to eat dinner.
