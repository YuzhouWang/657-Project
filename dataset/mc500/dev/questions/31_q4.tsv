Once upon a time I had a dog named @entity0. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play @entity0' favorite game. @entity0 loved playing fetch. One Saturday, @entity0 ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. @entity0 was not having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked @entity0 with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! @entity0 barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, @entity0 would run the other way.
