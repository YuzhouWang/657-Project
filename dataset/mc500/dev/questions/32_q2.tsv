"I do not think I can win the race" @entity0 told his parents over breakfast. His mother asked "Why not?" but his father was silent. @entity0 knew his father did not believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent @entity0 to a doctor to ask why his son was not a better runner. The doctor told him @entity0 could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he did not like to run.  @entity0, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run.  @entity0 answered, "I'm going to try to win, but @entity3 is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess."  "Well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said. @entity0 took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at @entity2:Zero today, instead of @entity2:Fifteen), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He did not even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named @entity1 that @entity0 sometimes pretended to be. @entity2:@entity20 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but @entity0 was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him.  It was almost Four:Zero before @entity0 saw the end of the run. By the time @entity0 reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. @entity0's father asked, "What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you would not win?"  @entity0 thought about why he signed up. It was not about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, @entity1.
