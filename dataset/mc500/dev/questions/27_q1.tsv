@entity0 had a bunch of money.  She had saved money her whole life.  But @entity0 was afraid of people stealing her money.  She planned to hide it.  First she moved it around in her house and hid it behind a wall.  Then she put her money in the attic.  But she still did not feel safe about her money.  She was sure someone would find it.  Finally she took it outside and started digging in the ground.  She buried it in the ground so no one would find it.  "It is going be safe here," said @entity0.  She was very pleased that she had hidden her money so well.  The next day after breakfast, she went outside to make sure her money was still there.  She stopped at the spot she thought she had buried it and began digging.  After some time she had not found it.  She climbed out of the hole and looked around.  She had used a tree as a way to mark the spot.  But she could not tell which tree. The wind was blowing and the trees all looked the same! She had used a brown spot on the ground to mark the spot. But she could not tell which brown spot it was!  She knew she was not lost.  @entity0 had hidden her money so well that no one could find it, and that included her!
