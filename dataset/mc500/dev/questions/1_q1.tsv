My mommy has a really cool job! She makes costumes for movie stars. She works in the attic of our house, so I get to see her work all the time. I watch every movie I can, and try to learn all of the different costumes by heart. @entity0 says if I work hard and keep up my practice, one day I'll get to to make costumes for movie stars too! That job sounds like heaven. One day I was in the attic, helping @entity0 make a boot for a costume.  They were covered in little beads, and mom had to sew them on. She kept dropping the needles on the ground. Then I was helping by picking them up. I was also helping by moving the lamp around so @entity0 could see the boot better.  "Ouch!" I said. "I accidentally stuck my finger with the needle!" My mommy looked at my finger, and gave it a kiss.  "Welcome to the life of a costumer!"
