@entity7 woke up to the sun shining in his eyes. He was so excited! Today was the big day for the baseball game and he was very excited! He rolled out of bed and jumped in the shower, whistling a happy song. Downstairs he could hear his baby brother, @entity0, crying and he had to giggle to himself. He got out of the shower and pulled on his clothes. He looked at the calendar on his desk and smiled knowing yesterday, Friday, had been the last day of school. "Hi, @entity4! No school Monday," he laughed. He gave his baby brother a kiss on the cheek and grabbed a piece of bacon. "Is that all you are eating, @entity7? You need to have a good meal before you leave." said mom. "Yes, I am meeting @entity8 and @entity5 at the playground and I am late."  He grabbed his glove and bat and ran outside, right into a mud puddle from last night's rain. He got to the playground and @entity8 was wiping his head. "Whew, it is very hot now!" "It is going to be a hot summer since it was so cold this winter. It is hard to believe last month there was snow on the ground." The boys jogged to the playing field and shook hands with the other boys. "This is going to be a great game, the first of the summer." one of the boys said. The game started and everyone had a turn. @entity7's team was behind by two points. @entity5 took his place at the plate. "Batter up!" The pitcher threw the first ball. "STRIKE ONE!" Then the second and crack, the bat hit the ball and it flew through the air. @entity5 ran to the first base. Next, @entity8 hit the ball with the first throw and he ran to first base and @entity5 stole third base. The third player was @entity10, a red headed boy. He was not a very good player and he missed the ball three times. "OUT." He was followed by @entity9 and he also made an out. Up came @entity3. He hit the ball and made it to first base, @entity8 moved to second and @entity5 stayed on third. @entity2! @entity6 @entity1! @entity7 ran around the bases and @entity5, @entity8, and @entity3 all made it in. @entity7 saved the game and the day! @entity7's team won the first game of the summer!
