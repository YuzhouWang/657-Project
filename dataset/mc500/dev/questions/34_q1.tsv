@entity0 started planning her new garden in the winter. She chose flowers and vegetables that could grow in her area. She looked through the seed magazines. She ordered the tastiest kind of each vegetable and the prettiest kind of each flower. She talked to a friend about her plans. It seemed like the snow would never melt. But @entity0 did not have to wait for spring to get started. @entity1 weeks before the last frost, @entity0 planted seeds indoors. The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow.  Finally spring arrived. Each day, @entity0 moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures. @entity0 worked in her garden, digging the soil. She added a special growing mix from the garden store to make the soil better. When everything was ready, she removed the seedlings from their trays and planted them in her garden. The warm sun and rich soil helped her vegetables and flowers grow.
