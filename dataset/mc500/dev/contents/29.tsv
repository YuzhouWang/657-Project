Tuesday was Square's favorite day.  Wednesday was nice because it was always Spaghetti Night.  Saturday was great because of the morning cartoons.  But Tuesday?  Tuesday was the day it always went to visit its friend Diamond.\newline\newlineIt was a beautiful day!  The spring wind was blowing, and the sun was shining.  Square and Diamond went to play by the river.  \newline\newlineThey were having a great time.  They swam.  They fished.  They played hide and seek.\newline\newlineSuddenly, the wind picked up.\newline\newline"Hey, Square!  Would you like to see a trick?"\newline\newline"Sure Diamond!  What is it?"\newline\newlineDiamond took a string out of its pocket.  Diamond tied it to her, and then she tied it to a tree.\newline\newline"Watch this!"  Diamond jumped into the wind.  Suddenly, she was flying!  She floated.  She swooped.  She played with the clouds and the birds.  She flew faster.  She flew slower.\newline\newlineAt first, Square was amazed.  But slowly, Square started to frown.\newline\newlineDiamond landed in front of her friend.  "What's wrong?"\newline\newline"That was amazing!  It looks like a lot of fun.  But I am not shaped like a kite.  I can't do those amazing things like you."\newline\newlineDiamond smiled.  "Yes you can, Square!  Stand on your tip-toes!"\newline\newlineSo Square did.\newline\newline"Now, go look at yourself in the river."\newline\newlineSquare walked to the river and looked down.  But he did not see a square.  He saw a diamond!\newline\newlineDiamond handed Square the string.  "Now jump!" she said.\newline\newlineSquare jumped.  He jumped as high as he could.  Just as he started to fall, the wind blew and picked him up.\newline\newlineHe was flying, like Diamond!\newline\newlineHe floated.  He swooped.  He played with the clouds and the birds.  He flew faster.  He flew slower.\newline\newlineHe soon landed.  The sun was setting, so they said goodbye and made plans to meet again next Tuesday.\newline\newlineIt was a beautiful day.	multiple: What did Square see in the river?	He saw a diamond.
