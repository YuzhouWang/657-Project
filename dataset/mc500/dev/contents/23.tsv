It loved to scream with all its might!\newline\newlineIt loved to roll in mud and sun.  Then it would go for a run.\newline\newlineBut why did it run?  Why did it scream?  \newline\newlineIt had a fork in its butt!  \newline\newlineIt sat in a trashcan.  This was not a smart thing to do!  But he did it, oh yes, oh me, oh you!\newline\newlineThe alligator had a beard.  It was a great beard.  But nobody ever talked about his beard.  Why?  Because they would only see the fork in its butt!\newline\newlineBut one day, the alligator made a friend.  The friend needed a fork.  How was he to eat his spaghetti without a fork?  \newline\newlineBut...I'm not sure a butt fork is the best way to eat spaghetti.\newline\newlineDo you?	one: What did the angel alligator have?	a trashcan	spaghetti	a spoon	a beard	one: What did the friend need?	an alligator	spaghetti	a butt	a fork	multiple: What was not a smart thing to do?	eating spaghetti	going for a run	rolling in the mud	sitting in a trashcan	multiple: What did the angel alligator love to do?	scream and roll	run and eat	eat and run	see and talk
