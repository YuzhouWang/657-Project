He liked playing tricks on people.  Sometimes he would call Mrs. Walker at the hat store and roar at her on the phone.  Sometimes he would leave his wet blanket on the sidewalk so that it would squish under people's feet when they walked past.  Sometimes he would moo at his sister, June, to annoy her.  One time he even painted his friend Jack's bedroom purple without asking.\newline\newlineThis upset Jack very much.  Jack did not want his bedroom to be purple.  Jack liked his bedroom blue and white, like his favorite sport's team.  Whenever Jack was sad his dog, Scamp, was also sad.  John's naughty actions really hurt Jack's feelings so he tried to hide from John.  John found Jack anyway.  \newline\newline"Why are you hiding from me?" asked John.\newline\newline"You were naughty.  You painted my bedroom without asking.  You even made Scamp sad and now his tail won't wag."\newline\newlineJohn felt very bad about hurting his friend's feelings.  He wanted to make his friend happy again.  The problem was he was out of paint.  John thought long and hard.  He had an idea!  He ran to his house and grabbed his favorite toy, his yellow dinosaur.  He handed it to Jack.  "I'm sorry about your room.  I won't do anything like that again.  I can't fix it right now, but you can have my dinosaur until I fix your room."\newline\newlineJack accepted John's apology and both boys were happy.  Scamp could wag his tail again.	multiple: How did John hurt Jack's feelings?	He put a wet blanket on the sidewalk.	He painted his bedroom purple.	He mooed at his sister.
