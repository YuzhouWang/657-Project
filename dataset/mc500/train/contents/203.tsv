They walk and talk about how different kindergarten is from the first grade. Jimmy and Jeremy are in different classes and they do different things. Jimmy's teacher has the kids do lots of arts and crafts making sock puppets, pasting pictures and many other things. Jeremy wishes he was in the same class as Jimmy because they are best friends and he likes doing arts and crafts. Jimmy tells Jeremy that they are going to be best friends even if they are in different classes, this makes Jeremy feel better. Jimmy remembers that Jeremy's birthday party is next week and he gets excited. Jimmy has the idea to make Jeremy a birthday cake with the help of his mother. They finally arrive at the corner where Jimmy lives and they promise to meet up the next morning for the walk to school.
