Her mom and dad were very kind to her. Her favorite thing to do was to play on the swings on the chocolate tree in their front yard with her friend Daisy. Emily always got first turn on the swings, and Daisy always pushed her, until it was Daisy's turn, and Emily would push Daisy.\newlineOne day, Daisy said that she wasn't going to push Emily on the swings if Daisy didn't get to swing first. This made Emily very mad. Her turn was always first, and Emily thought that it wasn't fair that Daisy wasn't going to push her if she didn't get to swing first. So she ran into the castle to tell her mom and dad the Queen and King.\newlineThe Queen and King listened to Emily's story, and they told Emily that it was Daisy's turn. "What?" said Emily. She was so mad! Emily always got the first turn!\newline"It's only fair to Daisy, Emily." said her mom. "Now go out there and push your friend on the swing."\newlineEmily went outside and pushed Daisy on the swing. After Emily pushed Daisy, Daisy pushed Emily, and Emily came inside still upset.\newline"Why did you make me push her on the swing first?" said Emily.\newline"Because that's how you keep friends, sweetie." said her mom the Queen. "If I were Daisy and I never got to get a turn first, I don't think I'd want to be friends."\newline"Okay, I think I understand that." said Emily. From then on, Emily and Daisy took turns being first on the swing, and they were friends for the rest of their lives.	one: What was Emily?	A rainbow.	A swing.	A princess.
