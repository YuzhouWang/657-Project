When she opened it, she saw her friend Faith standing on the porch. "Bill is going to build a fort in my backyard today, and I get to help," Faith said. "Would you like to come over and help too?"\newline\newlineBecca thought about what she had to do that day. Her mother had told her she needed to get her chores done before she could play at Faith's house. "First, I have to clean my room," Becca told Faith. \newline\newline"Maybe I can help you," Faith said. "I helped Sam clean his room once."\newline\newline"Sure!" Becca answered.\newline\newlineThe girls went to Becca's room and started to pick up toys and clothes. "Maybe I need to clean under the bed," Becca said. Under the bed, she found a library book she had been missing. Faith finished putting all of the clothes into the hamper.\newline\newline"Thanks for the help!" Becca said. "Now I can go with you."\newline\newline"I hope we don't have to clean my room, too!" said Faith.	multiple: Why did Becca clean her room?
