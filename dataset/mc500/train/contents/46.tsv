Many days they like to go to the park or to the swimming pool but today they chose to go to the grocery store.\newline\newlineThey went into the store and straight to look at the fruit. Emily looked at the lemons, the bananas, the apples and the pears.  In the end, Emily chose the apples and put them in a bag.  She handed the bag to her mother to put into their shopping cart.\newline\newlineThe pair went to the dairy section next and looked at the kinds of yogurt they store had.  There was blueberry, peach, strawberry and vanilla. Emily asked her mother what kind of yogurt they would be getting and her mother said they wanted the blueberry yogurt.\newline\newlineWhen they got to the checkout, Emily helped her mother when they needed to pay.  Emily gave the cashier two dimes and four pennies. \newline\newlineThey gathered up their bags, packed them into their car and drove home.	multiple: What fruit did Emily choose	pears	lemons	apples	bananas	multiple: What kind of yogurt did Emily choose?	strawberry	vanilla	peach	blueberry	one: Where did Emily and her mother chose to go?	the swimming pool	the park	to school	the grocery store	one: How many pennies did Emily give the cashier?	one	four	none	two
