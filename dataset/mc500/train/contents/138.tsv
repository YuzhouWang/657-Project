When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him. You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV. If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog."\newline\newlineJamey was very happy to hear this! The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept. It was very noisy inside! Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first. \newline\newline"This dog is pretty big, Jamey," his father said. "He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have."  \newline\newlineJamey thought that Dad was right about that. The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog. It barked over and over again as Jamey and his mother looked at it.\newline\newline"This dog is very noisy Jamey. He might need a lot of attention from you. Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?"\newline\newlineJamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy. Finally Jamey looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one. The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over.\newline\newline"Do you like the brown dog?" asked Jamey's dad.\newline\newline"Yes!" said Jamey. "Can we get him?"\newline\newline"Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?" asked Jamey's mom.\newline\newline"I promise," said Jamey.\newline\newline"In that case, I guess we have a dog!"\newline\newlineThis made Jamey very happy.	multiple: How many pets did Jamey look at before picking one?
