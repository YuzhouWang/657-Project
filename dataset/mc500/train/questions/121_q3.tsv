There once was a boy named @entity1.  He met @entity0 one afternoon at a park on a hot summer day.  They both started talking and became great friends.  They spent the whole day together and ate their lunches together next to the pond.  @entity1 sure enjoyed the park more than he liked going to the beach or store.  There were many ducks, frogs, birds and chipmunks playing around the pond.  In fact, one of the chipmunks even came up and stole @entity1's car keys when he was eating!  @entity1 knew that he needed to go have his keys, but the chipmunk ran with an evil smile on its face.  Eventually, the chipmunk ran into its hole that he called home.  @entity1 tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he could not find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, @entity0 came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.  In seconds, the chipmunk came out with the keys and dropped them in front of @entity1 right before grabbing the chip and running back into the hole.  The chipmunk then went in to have his snack and left @entity1 and @entity0 alone.  @entity1 thought that maybe next time he could go to the park in the early spring or winter so that the chipmunks would be busy sleeping during the cold weather months.  @entity1 then said goodbye to @entity0 and went home.
