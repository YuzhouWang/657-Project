One day, @entity0 and @entity1 went to the zoo with their mother. As soon as they arrived, @entity0 said she wanted to go see the bears and the lions. @entity1 did not want to see them at all, he wanted to see the monkeys. Their mother told them that they can see all of the animals, but they have to start with the sneaky snakes. After going around to some of the animals, @entity1 was happy to finally see the monkeys. As soon as they started to watch the monkeys, they started dancing by the window in front of @entity1, @entity0, and their mother. "Look! @entity1," their mother said, "those monkeys are dancing for you!" and @entity1 watched them happily dance and dance! When they stopped dancing, their mother told @entity0 it was time to see some scary lions and bears. @entity0 was not scared at all, she knew they were not going to get her. @entity0 bravely went to the section with the lions and watched them roaring at her and @entity1. @entity1 got scared and hid behind his mom. @entity0 was happy watching the lions. @entity2 was the bears, but they were all asleep by the time they got to see them. At the end of the day, @entity1 said he loved the monkeys the best, @entity0 said she loved the lions. Both, @entity0 and @entity1, said they loved the zoo.
