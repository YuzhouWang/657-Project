I love to bake cakes for my granddaughter @entity1. She gets so happy when she eats them! So one day, I thought I'd surprise her at school with cake for her school class! I thought that would make her love me even more. I went into the kitchen and washed my hands. Then I dried them on a dishtowel. I went to the refrigerator and took out my cake mix. Then I took out the special bottle of vanilla sauce! I always pour it in for @entity1. Her mom and dad like orange sauce, but @entity1 loves vanilla sauce. I mixed it in with the cake mix, and put it on the table. Then I went to turn on the oven. Then, a bad thing happened! My friendly old cat @entity0 jumped up to smell the mix! @entity0 also loves vanilla sauce! But then @entity0 accidently kicked the mix! It fell all the way from the table to the ground.  My lip tightened as I started to cry. Now, @entity1 would not have a cake for her class.  What a silly @entity0!
