@entity2 and @entity1 are brother and sister. They went to the beach with their family last July for a week, and had the best time ever!  On Monday, @entity2 and @entity1 wanted to build a giant sandcastle.  They invited their new friends @entity3 and @entity4 to help build the sandcastle. @entity3 and @entity4 had a house on the beach, so they were really good when it came to building sandcastles.  They hoped that they could make the sandcastle taller than themselves, but they soon found they needed more help. They asked their cousin @entity5 to help them build the biggest sandcastle in the world! @entity5 was not the friendliest cousin in the world, but to @entity2 and @entity1's surprise, @entity5 was happy to help build the sandcastle. @entity2, @entity1, @entity0, @entity4 and @entity5 had spent the whole day building the sandcastle, and finally, right before dinner time, they completed it. The sandcastle was huge! It had a river around the castle, and even a bridge to cross the river. It even had a flag at the top, and a wall that went around the castle too!  They were so happy! The rest of the week at the beach was a lot of fun for @entity2 and @entity1. On Tuesday, they went for ice cream. @entity1's ice cream fell and dripped all the way down to her tummy, but @entity2 gave her some of his. On Wednesday, they watched the fireworks at night. On Thursday, they went swimming all day long, moving like worms in the water. On Friday, they had to go back home. They were sad, so they started counting down the days until next year at the beach!
