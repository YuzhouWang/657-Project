@entity2 felt the very first rain drop hit his hat. "Let's go inside!" he said to his friend @entity0. The two ran inside the house as it began to rain more outside. @entity2's mother was very happy that they missed the rain and got inside before it made a big mess. @entity2 and @entity0 were not as happy. "What are we going to do in here all day?" asked @entity0. "I do not know" said @entity2, looking out the window as the rain came down. @entity1. And harder. "Oh no! I left my baseball glove outside" said @entity2 as he watched it begin to fill up with rain. His glove was going to be a mess! Thankfully, @entity2's dad pulled up in his car. Seeing the glove on the ground, he picked it up as he ran inside. "Careful sport, you almost lost this" he told his son as he tossed him the wet mitt. But @entity2 was not listening, he was looking past his dad as he walked through the door. The sky was clearing up! @entity2 ran outside, @entity0 came after him. "Look at that!" @entity0 said as he pointed at the sky. A rainbow was appearing, it was so beautiful! The rain was not bad after all!
