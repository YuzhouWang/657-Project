@entity1 wanted to build a tree house.  He needed to get a ladder to bring wood up the tree.  He went to his friend's house to borrow a ladder.  He also borrowed a bucket.  He needed the bucket to carry nails.  His friend is named @entity0.  The ladder was too big for @entity1 to carry alone.  He had @entity0 help him carry the ladder back home.  The ladder was heavy.  They were careful to stay on the sidewalk.  @entity1 got the hammer from his tool box.  He gave @entity0 a rope.  @entity1 and @entity0 got to work on the tree house.  They worked all day.  They painted the inside of the tree house blue.  They painted the outside of the tree house red.  They did not use green or orange paint.  They used the rope to climb down from the tree house.  When they were all finished, @entity1 helped @entity0 carry the ladder and bucket back to his house.   @entity1 thanked @entity0 for helping him.
