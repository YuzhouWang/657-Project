@entity0 woke up knowing that today was finally the day.  It was his birthday!  He had been waiting for this day all year long.  He was super excited to get all his presents and hoped he finally got the basketball he wanted.  As he ran outside, he saw his parents were not even awake yet!  He looked at the clock and it was still only six in the morning.  He tried to wake up his parents, but they told him to go back to sleep.  @entity0 went back to his bed and laid there until it was finally time to open presents.  His parents were brushing their teeth and taking a shower, so @entity0 waited outside where the presents were.  He saw that he had three gifts from his parents waiting for him.  He had really hoped there was a basketball.  The first gift he opened was a new pair of pants his mom had bought for him.  The second gift he opened was a picture of his favorite basketball player to hang on his wall.  @entity0 was starting to feel nervous as there was only one gift left!  He wished and wished with all his might for a basketball.  The last box was a square shape.  If it was a basketball, surely it would have been round!  He opened the box and saw that it really was a basketball!  His parents had put it in a box so it would not be clear.  He was so happy he hugged his parents and told them thank you.  His parents brought the cake out and he ate cake, holding on to his basketball the whole time. There was pizza and ice cream and chips, but @entity0 was too full and wanted to play with his new ball right away!
