@entity1 and his class were going to the ocean. Along with his class there were three adults going to make sure no one was left at the beach. @entity1 had three friends who were going too. His friends who were going were @entity3, @entity0 and @entity2. @entity3 was the first one on the bus. @entity1 was the second one on the bus. @entity0 got on next and then @entity2 got on last. If the sun was shining and there was not a storm, @entity1 was going to get to go on a boat to look for fish. If there was a storm then @entity1 would have to stay on the bus and he would not even get to walk on the beach or look for sea shells. @entity1 was happy to see that there was not a storm. @entity1 ran off the bus. He was so fast that he beat @entity3 getting off the bus. @entity2 got off the bus before @entity1, but @entity1 even beat @entity0 getting off the bus.  @entity1 and his friends had a fun day on the boat looking for fish.
