All the @entity0 bears felt excitement at the arrival of their new shirts; everyone except @entity1, he was a very unhappy bear who did not like to wear clothing. He also hated tying his shoes and matching his socks. These were all things @entity1 did not like doing.  So when the @entity0 bear king held a town meeting to pass out all the shirts, @entity1 stole the microphone and sang a song to express his feelings: "I wo not wear those shirts you bear bosses, I wo not wear my socks. I have all the fur I need, do not put me in a shirt box. I want to scratch the ground with my claws, and feel the wild wind; If you all make me wear, then my darlings as a bear, I think I'll smash you with my paws, and chew off all your skins." The other bears felt @entity1 had a point, and so they too chewed up the shirts, shoes, and socks the king gave them; and they chose a king who did not have a mustache and never, ever wore a shirt and tie.
