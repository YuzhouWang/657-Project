@entity3 went to the beach one day last summer. She went with her family. Her parents let her and her brother, @entity4, each bring one friend. @entity3 invited @entity1. @entity4 asked @entity2. Their neighbor @entity5 also went. The six of them got into @entity3's dad's car and began the long trip to the beach. In the car, they sang and played games together. They soon got the beach. @entity0 put on sun block and had lunch. They ate on a large, blue blanket. @entity3's mother had brought the blanket. After eating, everyone found fun things to do. @entity3 and @entity1 made sand castles with @entity3's father. @entity4, @entity5, and @entity2 swam in the sea and played catch. @entity3's mother sat in a chair and read a book. When the sun began to set, they packed everything up and began to drive home. Both @entity4 and @entity1 slept. @entity2 played a game with @entity3 and @entity5 before @entity5 fell asleep and started to drool. After they got home, everyone had dinner at @entity3's and talked about how much fun they had at the beach.
