@entity0 the pear lived in a bowl on the table. He was a plastic fruit, and no one could eat him. He sat in the bowl with Artie the apple and Gertie the grapes. He watched every day as the group of bananas that hung out in another basket got eaten one by one. He wished he could be taken along to work in a bag and brought along to eat. But day after day, he sat in the bowl with only his plastic friends. One day, a little boy walked over towards him and picked @entity0 up. @entity0 was very excited. The boy looked at the pear with hungry eyes. He put him up to his mouth and took a big bite. "Ewwww!!!" said the little boy, and he spit out the fake fruit all over the floor. He put @entity0 back in the bowl and ran away. @entity0 smiled to himself about his adventure.
