@entity0 walked past the barn, the big tree, and through the back yard to reach the chicken pen. @entity0 gathered the eggs from the chicken pen, so that her father could make scrambled eggs for breakfast. He would need at least Five eggs for the meal, two for @entity0 and three for himself. @entity0 could only find four eggs in the chicken pen. She looked under every chicken, and in every nest, but could not find another egg. She placed the four eggs in her basket, and began to walk toward the house, when she heard a quacking sound. She went toward the sound and found a nest near the pond, with large brown eggs inside. "Quack" said a nearby duck, as @entity0 took an egg from the nest. Now she had enough for breakfast.
