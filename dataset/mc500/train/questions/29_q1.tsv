In a zoo, many animals have claws: birds, dogs and lions. Even some monkeys have claws! One summer day, the eyes of many visitors were facing the lion cage. It was like the famous movie "The Lion King". One lion cub had been born and was drinking from its mother. There was a straw bed for the lions to sleep on, and all visitors loved to watch the baby lion cub. Well, a monkey (with claws) came into the lion's cage all of a sudden! But the lions were not afraid, because they are kings of the animal world. Also, they had seen the movie and knew what the monkeys wanted. So it happened that the monkey took the cub from its mother into its hands. It walked over to the gate by the visitors and held up the cub for all to see! People cried. People took pictures. They were seeing the real-life 'Lion King'!
