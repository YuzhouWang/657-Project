One morning, @entity1, @entity2, and I went out shopping for @entity3's day gifts.  First we went to buy some flowers.  I found a nice big bunch of pink roses that were very pretty.  Then we went and bought a card.  There were a lot to choose from, some of them had pictures of kids and some of them had pictures of animals.  @entity1 wanted to get one with a kid hugging his mommy but @entity2 wanted the one with a cat on it, and I wanted the one with a dog on it.  We ended up getting all three.  Then we went to buy ingredients so we could cook breakfast.  On @entity3's day I helped @entity1 make breakfast.  We made chocolate pancakes and eggs.  It was very messy but a lot of fun.  @entity0 loved getting breakfast in bed and she liked the flowers and cards.  We also went out to go to the park after breakfast.  It was a beautiful day and a lot of fun.  I ca not wait for mother's day to come by again!
