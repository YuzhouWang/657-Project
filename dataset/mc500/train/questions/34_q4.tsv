Sometimes @entity1 likes to go to the library. Her friend @entity2 also likes the library, but her other friend @entity0 does not like the library. @entity1 and @entity2 like to read about different things. They can learn about things that they do not know much about. They also like to read fun and exciting stories. The librarian, @entity3, knows @entity2 and @entity1, because they are in the library a lot. He knows what kind of books they like. When the library gets new books, he tells @entity1 and @entity2 about any books that he thinks they would like. @entity0 only goes to the library when he has to read a book for class. @entity3 does not know very much about @entity0, because @entity0 does not go to the library often. @entity1's favorite books are about airplanes, cars, and trains. She like reading about how fast they can go, and about the workers who build them. When she grows up, she is going to buy a fast car and travel to different states. @entity2 likes books about dinosaurs, cowboys, and fireworks. When he grows up, he is going to buy a costume and dress up like a cowboy.
