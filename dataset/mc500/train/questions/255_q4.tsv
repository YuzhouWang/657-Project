Once upon a time there was a cat named @entity3.  @entity3 was black with four white feet and a brown tail.  @entity3 had three friends.  They were @entity1 the dog, @entity2 the rooster, and @entity0 the duck.  When they were in school one day, their teacher told them the story of the super scary sock monster.  She warned them to stay as far away from the sock monster as they could.  Wanting to show how brave they were, @entity3, @entity1, @entity2, and @entity0 went off to take a picture of the sock monster.  Before they left, they each packed one type of fruit.  @entity3 packed an apple.  @entity1 packed a pear.  @entity2 packed a banana.  @entity0 packed a grape.It took a long time but they finally found the sock monster.  He lived in a cave.  The cave was under the school.  The sock monster was not looking in their direction when they found him.  As quiet as they could, they walked up to him.  @entity3 got the camera ready.  Just as @entity3 was about to take the picture, @entity0 tripped over a stick.  The noise caused the sock monster to look at the brave friends.  The sock monster was angry!  "He looks mad!  What can we do?" wondered @entity2?  "Maybe he likes fruit." said @entity3, "Let's throw him the fruit we packed."@entity3 gave the sock monster his apple.  The sock monster did not eat it.  @entity0 gave the sock monster his grape.  The sock monster did not eat it.  @entity2 gave the sock monster her banana.  The sock monster did not eat it.  @entity1 gave the sock monster her pear.  The sock monster ate it!  "Thanks!" said the sock monster.  "I was really hungry.  Pears are my favorite."No longer hungry, the sock monster let @entity3 take a picture.  The brave friends returned to their teacher and showed her the picture.  "You are all very brave," said the teacher.  "But you did not listen to me.  I am keeping the picture.  It is your punishment."The brave friends were very sorry.
