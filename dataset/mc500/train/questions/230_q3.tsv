When reindeer are done with the holiday season, people often wonder what they do during their time off.  Well, reindeer are pretty good at taking a vacation during down time. @entity2 of any age are always in a hurry for their own holidays! @entity3 is the most famous reindeer, and he has been known to ride foam noodles in the pool.  He loves to get wet and splash around! @entity1 has a more quiet time during his vacation.  You'll often see him looking in the fridge for his favorite cooking ingredient, cheese. He is a great cook and likes to make cheese pizza. @entity4 is pretty good at reindeer games, and he is always on the winning team during vacation time. He is always signing up for games all summer long. @entity0 loves to fly and ride the wind, even in his off time. He is always practicing. That's why he is the best at flying. So, that's what some of the reindeer do in their time off.  If you happen to see any reindeer doing funny things, they are on vacation!
