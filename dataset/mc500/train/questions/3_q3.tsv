@entity0 went to the farm to buy some beef for his brother's birthday. When he arrived there he saw that all six of the cows were sad and had brown spots. The cows were all eating their breakfast in a big grassy meadow. He thought that the spots looked very strange so he went closer to the cows to get a better look.  When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence. The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it.  @entity0 wondered where the dirty spots had come. Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared. All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food. After @entity0 got a good look at the cows he went to the farmer to buy some beef. The farmer gave him four pounds of beef for ten dollars. @entity0 thought that it was a good deal so he went home and cooked his brother dinner. His brother was very happy with the dinner.  @entity0's mom was also very happy.
