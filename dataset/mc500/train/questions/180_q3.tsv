Once upon a time there were four children.  Each of the children had a favorite color.  @entity0's favorite color was blue.  @entity1's favorite color was red.  @entity3's favorite color was purple and @entity2's favorite color was yellow.  They walked along the road one day and stopped to pick flowers for their mother.  @entity1 picked a handful of red flowers.  "Mom is going to love these!" he said.  @entity3 picked a handful of purple flowers.  "These are perfect for mother," She thought.  @entity2 picked two handfuls of yellow flowers.  "Yellow flowers are so pretty for mom's kitchen," she said.  @entity0 looked and looked, but could not find any blue flowers.  He looked along the road, but there were no blue flowers.  He looked by the stream, but there were no blue flowers. He was very sad.  They walked along the road toward home to give their flowers to their mother.  @entity0 walked very slowly and hung his head because he did not have any flowers to give his mother.  As they neared their home, @entity0 saw a small bunch of blue flowers growing near the fence.  He was so happy he picked them all and rushed to catch up with his brother and sisters.  When they got home they gave their mother all the flowers they had picked.  She thanked them and put them on her kitchen table.  "I have the most thoughtful children in the world," She said.
