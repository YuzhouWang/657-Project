It was one week before @entity3 and @entity2 still needed to find the perfect costume for trick-or-treating. Last year @entity2 was a scarecrow, so his mother had stuffed his clothes with straw. @entity2 thought that it was okay for a nine year old, but now he was ten and had to do even better. His friends @entity1 and @entity0 were going as a ghost and angel, but @entity2 wanted something that was both scary and real. Finally he came up with an idea and headed off to the store with his mother to collect the items. He picked up a black jacket, black gloves, and black cloth. After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished. When he got to school he would not tell anyone what his costume was. He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him. The next day was @entity3, so @entity1 and @entity0 came over to @entity2's house to meet him for trick-or-treating. They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby. They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, "wait for me" from the same direction as the wolf. When they looked again they saw @entity2 standing up and laughing. His costume was so real that it had tricked them both. "Great costume," they thought, "we'll have to do better next year" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors.
