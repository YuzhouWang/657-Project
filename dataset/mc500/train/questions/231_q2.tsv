There once was a girl named @entity5 who had a really close friend named @entity9.  They really liked being with each other, only it was difficult as @entity5 lived in @entity1 and @entity9 lived in the @entity0.  Because they both liked traveling and @entity5 wanted to see @entity9, she planned a trip to see him in the @entity0 one summer.  They had planned to travel around where @entity9 lived and then go to see @entity2 at one point in order to see the sights and have a really nice steak dinner together.  Once @entity5 arrived and met @entity9 at the airport, she ran up to him and jumped into his arms, giving him a great big hug.  They drove home where @entity9 helped @entity5 organize her things before they changed and watched a movie together.  The next day, they went out to have breakfast at the diner.  They thought about getting eggs, @entity4 toast, or cereal... but could not make up their minds.  Finally, @entity9 asked the worker to bring out pancakes for the two of them to share.  They had a really fun time together, visiting the beach, watching movies, and even visiting @entity2 like they had planned.  In the morning, they went to see the @entity8 building.  In the afternoon, they saw the Statue of @entity7 and @entity6.  At night, they went to have their dinner and went back to their hotel.  As @entity5's trip was ending, @entity5 became really sad about leaving @entity9.  They talked and came up with a plan for the months ahead which made @entity5 feel a lot better.  @entity5 then went home and waited for @entity3 to come to see her.
