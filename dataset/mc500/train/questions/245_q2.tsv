The day was dark and stormy; puddles could be seen all over the ground, making the yard look like a tiny pond.  @entity0 frowned as he let the curtain drop back down. There was no way that mommy was going to let him go out and play today. She would say that it was too muddy and he would get wet. @entity0 thought to himself, "But what if I do not ask her?"  Smiling, @entity0 pushed open the sliding door to the back yard.  Slipping on his rain boots, he rushed outside and began to run and jump from puddle to puddle, sending large showers of water up around him with every jump. After he had jumped in all of the puddles he looked back towards the house to find mommy standing in the doorway watching him with a smile on her face. She giggled as she too pulled on her rain boots and joined him in jumping from puddle to puddle.
