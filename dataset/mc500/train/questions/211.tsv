We swam around in the lake and splashed water on other kids.We got back on our bikes and rode back home. @entity0 made lunch. It was yummy, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and milk.Then it was time for our nap. We woke up and watched some TV.@entity0 gave us some money for candy later. @entity2 and I went back to the park to play.@entity2 and I played with a baseball with some other kids.Then we played with the football.We went to the store across the street.We bought some candy with the money @entity0 gave us.We went back to the park and watched the other kids play as we ate our candy.It was hot, so we went swimming again.  It was fun!We like swimming so we go swimming almost every day.We swam all afternoon until @entity0 came down to the park at told us to come home.@entity0 was very upset because we were gone so long.@entity0 was worried that something might have happened to us.@entity0 was not paying attention to her kids and what they were doing for hours. @entity2 and I told @entity0 she needs to pay more attention to us.@entity0 started crying, then @entity2 and I started crying.@entity0 said from now on, I must pay more attention to you two. @entity1 came home from work and playing softball for his company team.@entity1 wanted to know what was going on.@entity1 saw that we were all crying.@entity1 started to cry too.We all said that we would pay more attention to each other.We all said that we would do more things together like going to the park.We all said we would eat together more often.
