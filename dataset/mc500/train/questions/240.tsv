A guy with brown hair was named @entity1. His daughter was @entity0 and her favorite activity was riding her yellow bike. Sometimes she would put a card in the spokes of the wheel. This made her bike sound much faster than it was going. Once when she was riding down a hill, she went too fast and hit a trashcan. Other than having a bad smell, she was ok but was afraid to tell her father what had happened. So she told a lie. When she looked her father in the eye, he saw that there was more to the story. When he found out @entity0 was not being truthful, he had to give her a spanking. He told her that telling lies is wrong, but he loves her.
