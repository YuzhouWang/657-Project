@entity1 was driving. It was late, it was dark, it was raining, and he was out of cookies. His squirrel was asleep in the passenger seat, as was his hamster, in the back seat. He had gone down to the beach for the day, but it had started raining, so he had started driving back. But he had gotten lost. Now, he thought he was on the right way back.His headlights were not very strong. He could only see a few feet in front of him, except when the lightning hit. When the thunder came after, his squirrel, @entity2, and his hamster, @entity0, turned over in their sleep.Suddenly, lightning and thunder hit at the same time. There was a bright light and a crunching sound. A tree fell in front of the car!@entity1 hit the brakes. The car slowed down and stopped, and he got out. @entity1 walked up to the tree. He tried pushing it. It was too heavy. What would he do?He heard the car door open and shut behind him.It was @entity2! And @entity0!Together, the three of them pushed. @entity2 and @entity0 were small, but strong. And together, they moved the tree.They got back in the car. @entity1 was wet, and turned on the heater. He was tired, but he knew he would get home now - thanks to his animal friends.
