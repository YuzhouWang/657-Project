There once was an alligator named @entity1 (who wore an office shirt). He had two good friends - @entity0 the cat and Gary the hamster. Gary often rode around in @entity1's shirt pocket, since it would be hard for him to keep up with @entity1 and @entity0 as they walked around. One day, as they were wandering around, a storm popped up, forcing them to hurry indoors to deal with it. Unfortunately for them, they could not find a building quickly, so they ended up being frosted over by the dangerous weather. "If we do not get out of this soon, I might die!" yelled Gary, who was cold. "Do not worry, no one's going to die!" yelled @entity1, who, as a reptile, was even worse off than Gary. Luckily, they found a house after leaving the forest, which happened to be near the ocean. They ran inside, and dried off, before they headed to sleep.
