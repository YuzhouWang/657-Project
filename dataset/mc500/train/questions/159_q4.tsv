@entity1 got a big surprise when he came home from school one day. He found an angel in his room. His grandma had always told him angels were real. @entity1 had not believed her when she told him stories. She had also told him stories about mermaids, @entity0, leprechauns, and other things. Now, he knew at least one thing she had told him was true. He thought angel wings had to be white. This angel's feathers were many colors. They were red, blue, and green. No white ones that he could see. They looked at each other without speaking. Then, the angel began to talk. He told @entity1 he had to listen to his grandma, and believe her stories. @entity1 said he would. @entity1 asked the angel what it was like to fly. The angel told @entity1 it could show him. @entity1 would have to beat it at a game. @entity1 hoped it would be checkers or chess. His dad had taught him those. He was also good at card games. Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors. @entity1 beat the angel two out of three times, so he won. @entity1 and the angel then went for a long ride. After they flew, the angel dropped @entity1 back at home. It told @entity1 he had to promise not to tell anyone. @entity1 asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father. The angel said it did. @entity1 said he would. The angel left. They met a few more times and became good friends.
