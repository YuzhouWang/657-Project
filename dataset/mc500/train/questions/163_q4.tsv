@entity1 was so happy to finally meet his cousin. Just this morning he found out what a cousin is. A cousin is somebody who has the same grandmother and grandfather as you. He did not even know he had a cousin and now they were going to play together. This was going to be a great day.  Right after he ate lunch and had a quick piece of candy for snack he pulled out the letter that his cousin @entity0 wrote to him. He read it over and over again. They liked so many of the same things, like riding bikes and playing games. It was only twelve o'clock and @entity1 did not know if he would make it until @entity0 got here. He had two more hours to go. @entity1 fell asleep as he was reading a book and woke up to the sound of a car outside. It must be them! He jumped up and ran downstairs and right out the door to the car. That's when he saw @entity0 through the car window. @entity1 was really surprised. @entity0 had a ponytail! @entity0 was a girl!  It turned out that @entity1 still really liked his cousin @entity0, even if she was a girl.
