Once there was a boy named @entity1 who liked to play at being a cowboy. One day he was playing at chasing Indians in his room when he heard a loud crack of thunder. He got really scared. @entity1's parents, @entity0 and @entity3, came into his room. They told him not to be scared. They said they were going to make sure the car windows were shut and they would be back soon. @entity1 said okay. He climbed under his bed and listened to the wind outside. He had his favorite toy gun to keep him safe, but he was still scared because his parents were not back yet. His brother @entity2 had given him the gun. @entity1 started to think he could hear voices in the wind. It sounded like a strange kind of chanting. He started to shake and hug his toy gun. He said, "I'm not afraid of you. If you try to hurt me I'll shoot you." After that he felt a little better. But then he jumped as his bedroom door slammed shut. He hit his head on the bottom of his bed and it hurt. He looked out from under his blanket and saw a strange orange light in his room. He was worried that it was on fire, but he could not smell any smoke.
