It was the @entity1 of July and @entity0 the cowboy had a meal planned. He was going to cook for the whole town and do it in a bear costume, which was what they did in his part of the nation to celebrate the holiday and was not weird at all.  Unfortunately @entity0 had mistaken powdered soap for sugar because the eye holes in his bear costume did not quite match up with his own eyes. He put the whole box of soap in the strawberry punch that he meant to give to his party guests. "Try the punch," @entity0 said.  Since they did not want to be mean, after all @entity0 went through a lot of trouble in order to respect the town's bear costume wearing ways, the whole town drank the gross drink. No one got sick, but they were all pretty grossed out and after talking to each other planned to help @entity0 make the meal next year to keep it from happening again.
