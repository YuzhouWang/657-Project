@entity3 was a normal student. However, she was barely passing her classes this year. Her finals were coming up in a few weeks and @entity3 was very nervous about her @entity4 test. She was never very good at @entity4. Her brother always teased her because he was great at @entity4, @entity5, and @entity2, but she preferred Art. To raise her grades, @entity3 spent the week before finals studying every day in the school library. On the last day before the test, @entity3 walked in and was ready to work hard like she had every day that week. Except this time she looked over and saw her best friend, @entity0, walking up to her. @entity0 greeted @entity3 and told her that she wants to help her study for the @entity4 test. The two girls spend the rest of the afternoon looking over their class notes. By the end of the day, @entity3 finally felt ready. She left and walked back to her house. That night @entity3 made sure to get lots of sleep. She awoke early and had a filling breakfast before making her way to school. Her teacher, @entity1, handed out the @entity4 tests and she began to work. She felt like she did a really good job, but she was scared, too. @entity3 had to wait until tomorrow to see how she did. The next day she hurried back to class. @entity3 walked in and grabbed her test from the stack of papers. She let out a yell. @entity3 had failed. She turned to her friend @entity0 and started to cry. She was so upset.
