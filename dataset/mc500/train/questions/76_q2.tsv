@entity2 the dragon liked the color green. He did not like golden coins. They were too yellow. Every day he would go out and find green things to cover his bed of old treasure. He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave. The other dragons were worried.  When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants.  They were afraid @entity2 might get hurt. @entity2 did not think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed.  One day he went to visit his friend @entity0 and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace. "What's that?" he asked.  "That's a green stone," she told him. "Sometimes my treasures have them. I do not really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things."  "If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?" @entity2 asked. "Yes you can," @entity0 said, "But it has to be treasure, or things that will not catch fire."  So @entity2 went to go find treasure. When he was gone @entity0 told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to @entity2 too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave.  Soon @entity2 had more than enough green stones to cover his bed.  @entity1 stones never got old and brown.  They do not catch fire either.  So, now everyone was happy.
