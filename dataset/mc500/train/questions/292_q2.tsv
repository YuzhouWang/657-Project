Once there was a young girl named @entity2.  @entity2 was very nervous because she was about to give a speech for school.  The student that gave the best speech would win free tickets to see the fireworks.  @entity2 had spent a lot of time practicing her speech because she really wanted to win.  She practiced in front of her cousin, @entity1.  She practiced in front of her stuffed tiger, @entity3.  She practiced saying her speech as she stood on one leg and looked at the ceiling.  She even practiced burping her speech!Despite all that practice, @entity2 was still very nervous.  So many other kids were giving speeches that day and they all were going to try their best!  As @entity2 was walking in to the school she saw a penny on the ground.  Her mother had always told her that pennies were lucky so she picked it up.  With the penny in her hand she felt less nervous.  It was her new lucky coin.When @entity2's turn came she gave her speech.  She remembered all of the words to her speech and she remembered to smile at the right times.  Her hard work and her lucky coin worked.  She won the free fireworks tickets!  @entity2's teacher, @entity0, was so proud of her that he turned her lucky coin into a necklace.  @entity2 wore it everywhere she went from then on.  The fireworks were pretty cool too.
