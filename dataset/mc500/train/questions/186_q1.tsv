@entity4 was outside playing. It was very hot out and he got really thirsty. He saw that @entity0 was setting up a table with sodas and snacks down the street. @entity4 was very excited because this would solve his problem. He checked his pockets. They were empty. Where did his money go? This was a problem. In order to get a soda and snack he would need money. @entity4 ran home as fast as he could. He was in a rush. He passed by @entity1 as he was running. He asked @entity4 why he was running. "No time," @entity2. When he got inside the house @entity4 was very happy. His money was on his dresser in his bedroom. @entity3 goodness. He had enough money to get a soda. @entity4 ran back outside, but this time he slowed down when he saw @entity1. He told @entity1 to come with him to @entity0's table. He had enough money to buy them both a soda.
