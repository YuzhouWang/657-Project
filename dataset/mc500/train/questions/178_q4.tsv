There was once a magical lightning wand that contained special powers. When held by a human, it is believed to have given the human special powers that would allow them to take over the skies and the sea. Because of its dangerous power, a king named @entity0 wanted to hide the wand on a planet where no one could find it. Before @entity0 went out to hide his wand, he had to tie his shoelaces. Instead of tying them with his hands, he waved the wand to make it do it for him. Instead of tying his shoes, the wind and sky blew the shoes right off of @entity0. @entity0 cried and cried because he no longer had shoes. After Seventeen days of crying, @entity0 saw that his life was not terrible without shoes, because he still had a magical wand. @entity0 then forgot about his shoes and instead made a magical land called "Wind and @entity1" for children to gather and play in the fun wind and seas. @entity0 forgot about his shoes after a couple of years and even went on to go to school and get smarter. @entity0 is now a fireman and is glad that he never hid the wand. He now can never die and whenever he thinks of his shoes, he says to himself "Stop it!"
