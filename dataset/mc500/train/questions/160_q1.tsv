@entity6 was very excited when she woke up this morning. It was finally the last day of school and she was going to get the whole summer off. She was so excited because this summer she and her family would be traveling to @entity5. She had always wanted to visit @entity0 after her friend @entity2 visited @entity8 and Italy the summer before and came back knowing all sorts of funny words. She was going to get to see the @entity3, try all kinds of new food, and meet a whole bunch of new people. She was a bit worried because she did not speak any @entity4. She wanted to meet some of the people there and become friends. She did not know how well that would work if she could not talk with them. Overall she was still quite excited. She would miss seeing her friends at home this summer. If she were in @entity5 she would miss the happy days of playing baseball with @entity7 and @entity2 or going to movies to hide from the heat with her good friend @entity1, or getting lost wandering in the woods behind her house. Oh well, it was time to get ready for school, she would have to enjoy this last day with them before heading out on her adventure.
