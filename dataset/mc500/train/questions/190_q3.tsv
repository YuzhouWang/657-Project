@entity0 was a princess that lived in a castle made out of rainbows and chocolate. Her mom and dad were very kind to her. Her favorite thing to do was to play on the swings on the chocolate tree in their front yard with her friend @entity2. @entity0 always got first turn on the swings, and @entity2 always pushed her, until it was @entity2's turn, and @entity0 would push @entity2.One day, @entity2 said that she was not going to push @entity0 on the swings if @entity2 did not get to swing first. This made @entity0 very mad. Her turn was always first, and @entity0 thought that it was not fair that @entity2 was not going to push her if she did not get to swing first. So she ran into the castle to tell her mom and dad the @entity1 and King.The @entity1 and King listened to @entity0's story, and they told @entity0 that it was @entity2's turn. "What?" said @entity0. She was so mad! @entity0 always got the first turn!"It's only fair to @entity2, @entity0." said her mom. "Now go out there and push your friend on the swing."@entity0 went outside and pushed @entity2 on the swing. After @entity0 pushed @entity2, @entity2 pushed @entity0, and @entity0 came inside still upset."Why did you make me push her on the swing first?" said @entity0."Because that's how you keep friends, sweetie." said her mom the @entity1. "If I were @entity2 and I never got to get a turn first, I do not think I'd want to be friends.""Okay, I think I understand that." said @entity0. From then on, @entity0 and @entity2 took turns being first on the swing, and they were friends for the rest of their lives.
