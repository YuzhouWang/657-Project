@entity3 and @entity4 wanted to get something to eat for lunch. @entity1 and @entity2 went to school lunch room, but @entity3 and @entity4 wanted to leave and get something outside. They both go to the same school and have the same lunch period, which is how they know each other. They are allowed to leave school for One hour for lunch. They get together and rule out pizza, pasta, spicy food and chips. They also want to go somewhere close because they only have an hour.
