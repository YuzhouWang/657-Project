@entity0 loved watching television. He would wake up and watch Cartoons on @entity4. His favorite cartoon was @entity1. After his mom picked him up at the bus stop, he would go home and watch the @entity5. One day, his mom told him he was not allowed to watch cartoons after school.  He was very sad. She told him he had to go outside to play. He walked into the backyard. @entity3 was running around. He started to chase him. He picked up a ball and threw it. @entity3 ran after it and brought it back. @entity0 laughed. He chased after @entity3 and scratched his back. Maybe being outside was not so bad after all! He played with @entity3 for another hour until his mom called him inside. It was dinner time. @entity2 was fried chicken and mashed potatoes-his favorite. He was happy his mom made him go outside. He would go outside every day after school now!
