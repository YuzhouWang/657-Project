@entity2 was in his backyard.  He held a big basket full of clean clothes for his mother to hang. A little spotted dog ran into their backyard.  He jumped up and grabbed a sock from @entity2's basket!  He ran as fast as he could and disappeared into the bushes. "I must get that sock back!" @entity2 said.  "That sock is my favorite!"  He ran into the bushes after the little spotted dog. @entity2 saw @entity1 in the next yard over cooking at his grill.  "@entity1," @entity2 said.  "Did you see a dog with a sock?" "I sure did!" @entity1 said.  "The little dog ran around and around and then ran into the next yard!" @entity2 ran after the dog into the next yard.  He saw Mrs. Tomly reading a book on a chair.  "Mrs. Tomly," @entity2 said.  "Did you see a dog with a sock?" "I sure did!" Mrs. Tomly said.  "The little dog ran around and around then ran into the next yard!" @entity2 ran after the dog into the next yard.  There, he saw a cat laying on a table.  "Mr. Cat," @entity2 said.  "Did you see a dog with a sock?" The cat opened one eye.  Then it pointed to the next yard over with his tail. @entity2 ran into the next yard.  He saw Mrs. Han sitting on a chair petting the little spotted dog.  The dog had his sock. "That is my sock!" @entity2 said. Mrs. Han smiled and gave @entity2 back his sock.  "@entity0 here only wanted to play." @entity2 petted @entity0.  "I want to play too," he said to the dog.  "As long as you do not steal my socks!" @entity0 barked happily.  He and @entity2 played the rest of day together.
