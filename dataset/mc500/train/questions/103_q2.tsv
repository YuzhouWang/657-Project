@entity0's @entity1 "Meow." @entity0 eyes opened wide when she heard that sound coming from the basket her mother was holding. "Mama, what's that sound? It sounds like a kitty!" she said to her mother as she tried to reach the basket. Her mother was holding it up too high for @entity0 to reach. "@entity0," her mother said, "remember I told you that maybe we can get a pet if you could take good care of it? Well, you're seven years old now and I think you're ready for a special present." @entity0's mother set the basket on the floor. @entity0 fell on her knees with a big grin on her face. She slowly lifted the yellow kitty and held its soft little body next to hers.  @entity0 gave the kitty a little kiss. Then she rubbed its head and neck. Soon it started making gentle sounds. "Why is the kitty making those funny sounds?" she asked her mother. "Oh, that's called purring. It's the sound kittens make when they're happy," her mother said. "Can I give it a name?" @entity0 asked. "Sure. It's a girl kitty, but choose any name you like." her mother said. @entity0 thought about it as her mother got two small bowls and placed them on the floor. Then she put water in one bowl and kitten food in the other bowl. "Okay, @entity0. Let's see if the kitty is hungry." @entity0 put the kitty on the floor and it walked over to the food bowl. It quickly started to eat the food. @entity0 laughed at the kitten and said, "I know. I'm going to name you Kitty."
