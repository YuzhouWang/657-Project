@entity4 walked toward the time machine. His adult neighbor, the scientist, had asked him to watch it for him for the weekend. He had also asked @entity4 not to touch it. But it was a time machine. @entity4 had to see it. The machine was big and silver and shiny and looked like an ice cream cone that had been dropped. It had a square hole as tall as @entity4 and it hummed like a fridge. @entity4 took a deep breath and stepped inside. Just a peek, he thought. There were three buttons inside. One said "past," and one said "present." Another said "space." @entity4 looked at the buttons. He looked at the buttons some more. He waited and without thinking, his arm jumped out in front of him. He pushed the button that said "past." There was a bright light! And bam! @entity4 stepped out of the machine. It was raining, and there were many strange looking trees. The air was warm. The dirt below was muddy. He took a deep breath. "So this is the past," @entity4 said. Just then he heard a bump. And another one. The ground shook. The bumps got louder and the ground shook harder. A tree fell. @entity4 heard a roar. Two more trees fell. Suddenly, @entity4 saw it: A @entity2! @entity4 was so scared he could not breathe. The T. Rex looked up, and left, and right. He sniffed the air and leaned down. He did not seem to see @entity4. Then @entity4 sneezed. And the T. Rex started walking towards him. @entity3 and faster. @entity0. @entity0 bump. @entity0bumpbumpbump until he was running. @entity4 jumped back into the time machine and pressed "present." There was a bright light and @entity4 was back home. He took a deep breath. He was home. "Phew," he said. Next time, he would listen to his adult neighbor, he thought.
