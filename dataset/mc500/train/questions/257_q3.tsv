@entity0 and @entity1 travel to and from school every day.  @entity0 lives further from the bus stop than @entity1 does, stops every morning at @entity1's house to join him to walk to the bus stop.  Every afternoon, after school, when walking home from the bus stop they go in for cookies and milk that @entity1's mother has ready and waiting for them. @entity1 ca not eat cheese or cake so they had the same snack every day.  They both work together on their homework and when they are done they play together.  @entity0 always makes sure to leave in time to get home for dinner.  She does not want to miss story time which was right before bedtime. One morning @entity0 walked up to @entity1's house, she thought something might be wrong because normally @entity1 was waiting outside for her and on this morning he was not to be found.  @entity0 went up to the door and knocked. She waited and waited and yet no one answered.  She saw that @entity1's mother's car was not in their driveway which was weird.  She waited for a few bit looking up and down the block and getting worried when @entity1 was nowhere to be found. @entity0 did not want to miss the bus to school and hurried off to make it in time.  The bus driver saw that she was upset and that @entity1 was not with her that morning. She told him what happened and he said that he was sure that everything would be okay. @entity0 got to school, ran to her teacher and told him what happened that morning.  The teacher smiled and told her not to worry, @entity1's mother had called and he was going to the dentist and would be at school after lunch and that she would see him at the bus stop like normal tomorrow.
