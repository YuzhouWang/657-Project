@entity0 was sitting at home reading his favorite book.  The story was about cakes.  @entity0 thought to himself, "I am going to go to the store and get stuff to make a cake!"   @entity0 headed to the grocery store to get the cake ingredients.  @entity0 was going to make a banana and chocolate cake.  On his way he saw his friend @entity1, a small wolf.  @entity1 was also heading to the store.  @entity1 was going to make a pie for his mother.  He needed to get strawberries and blueberries.  @entity0 asked @entity1 if he wanted to walk to the store together.  @entity1 the wolf said yes, so they walked to the store together.  At the store the other people looked at @entity0 and @entity1.  They had never seen an alligator and a wolf who are friends before.  @entity0 and @entity1 laughed at this.  @entity0 got the chocolate and bananas to make his cake and @entity1 got the strawberries and blueberries to make his pie.  They left the store.  @entity0 waved good bye to @entity1.  "See you later alligator," said @entity1.  @entity0 went home and made his cake, it was very good.
