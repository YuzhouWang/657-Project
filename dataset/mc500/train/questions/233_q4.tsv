@entity0 was sitting in his room working on his homework. It was something he did since he went to kindergarten. @entity0 could see outside from where he was sitting. He had a view of a beautiful sunset this time of year. It was late spring, and he sometimes found his mind wandering as he looked outside, and hated losing time like that. The sooner he finished his homework, the sooner he could go to his friend @entity1's house, where he was spending the night. @entity0 loved sleepovers with @entity1. They would do fun stuff like tell jokes, watch TV, play board games, and eat lots of junk food. @entity1 also had a cool RC car that @entity0 liked to play with. But @entity0's parents would not allow him to go to @entity1's house until he finished his homework first.
