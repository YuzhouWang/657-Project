@entity2 was a little boy who lived by a big lake by the woods.  One day he saw two little mice looking at the water.  They seemed very sad. "What is wrong?" @entity2 asked. @entity1, one of the little mice, stood.  "My brother and I love to see new things.  We want to see what is on the other side of the lake.  But we do not know how to build a boat to get there." @entity2 smiled.  "I have plenty of toy boats," he said.  "They are your size!" "Oh, thank you!" said @entity0, the other little mouse.  "We would be very glad if we could borrow it!" @entity2 went to his house and returned with a small toy boat.  The boat had a big sail to make the boat go.  @entity1 and @entity0 climbed on and @entity2 put the boat into the water. The boat sailed away across the water!  @entity1 and @entity0 laughed with joy and had great fun riding the toy boat. Soon, they reached the other side of the lake.  Many people were having fun swimming and splashing in the water.  @entity0 and @entity1 loved seeing all the new things and people. A man threw a ball into the water.  It landed by the toy boat.  The man's big dog came splashing into the water to fetch it.  The big waves splashed the little boat every which way!  @entity1 and @entity0 got very wet. @entity1 and @entity0 went back home after that.  They told @entity2 of what they saw, and they all laughed at the big dog's wave.  Tomorrow the mice would see even more of the lake on @entity2's toy boat!
