@entity1 went to the library with her mother.  First she had to turn in the books she was returning at the return desk.  They said hello to the man there.  He took their books.  Then they went into the adult reading room.  @entity1 sat in a brown chair at the table.  She made a drawing of her mother.  Her mother found a large red book.  Then they went to the @entity0 section.  @entity1 sat in a blue chair.  She drew a picture of her brother.  Her mother found the book.  It was a green book.  Finally it was time to go to the children's room.  It was Story Hour.  @entity2 was there to read to all the children.  She read a book about friendship. After the story @entity1 sat in the red chair and began drawing.  They were drawing pictures of friends.  @entity1 drew a picture of her best friend Lilly.  @entity2 hung the pictures on the wall.  Then @entity1 and her mother picked out Eight books to read at home.  They checked the books out and went home.
