@entity6 spent the weekend at a family party in @entity1, @entity0. While she was there, she played with her cousin @entity2. The two of them rode tricycles, shared presents, and bought their favorite gum together. @entity6's favorite part of the weekend was swimming in the lake with @entity2 and her dog, @entity3. @entity3 did not like the water at first, but soon was splashing around with them. His favorite thing to do was fetch sticks from the water. They also went on a fast boat around the lake. @entity2's favorite thing to do was ride in a tube behind the boat. When they got out, they were soaking wet. They dried off with towels before going to @entity4's @entity5 for some lemon ice box cake. @entity3 got so muddy at the lake! When they got back to the cabin, they had to give him a bath. Because they were so active during the day, they fell asleep quickly and slept until the morning.
