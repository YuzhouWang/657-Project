Once upon a time, there was an old man named @entity5. @entity5 loved to eat peaches. In fact, @entity5's whole family, including his mother @entity6, his father @entity4, and his brother @entity0 loved to eat peaches. @entity5 would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. @entity5 and his best friend, @entity2, shared their love for peaches. One day @entity5 and @entity2 started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After Six years of waiting, One lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees @entity5 and @entity2 planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. @entity5 and @entity2 were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for @entity3 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and @entity5 and @entity2 were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than @entity1 peaches on it. @entity5 and @entity2 started shouting for joy.
