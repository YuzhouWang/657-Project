@entity1 is an adult. He is looking for a job. He hopes to become a clown someday. He wants to be a clown because he loves making people laugh. In order to be a clown, @entity1 must go to clown school. One day, @entity1's friend tells him about a clown school in @entity0. @entity1 becomes excited! The next day, @entity1 goes to the clown school in @entity0. @entity1's friend does not go with him. @entity1's friend does not want to be a clown because he does not like to look weird. When @entity1 arrives at clown school, he sees a clown riding on a blue tricycle. The clown asks, "What are you doing here?" @entity1 says, "I want to become a clown." "Well, can you ride this blue tricycle?" the clown asked. "Yes," @entity1 said. He rode the blue tricycle all around the clown school. In the classrooms, in the gym, and in the lunchroom. "You have what it takes to be a clown," the clown said, "you are accepted to clown school."
