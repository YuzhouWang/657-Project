@entity0 the kitten loved to hunt for mice. He was black with white boots. @entity0 was still a baby, so he liked to play all night long and sleep during the day. His favorite toy is a little fake squeaky mouse. One day, @entity0 was waking up from a long nap. He saw a little mouse out of the corner of his eye. He jumped up and began to chase him around the room. He ran and ran until the mouse went into a little hole in the wall. Mary the mouse was so scared. She sat in the hole in the wall and cried little mouse tears. @entity0 heard the mouse crying and said "Do not worry little mouse I want to play with you! Do you want to play too? Let's play hide and seek!" The mouse poked her head out and said "Sure!" I'm it first!" And @entity0 took off around the corner with Mary chasing behind him.
