My dad runs the Blue Street @entity2. @entity1 calls him the @entity0. That means @entity5 is the @entity2 Queen. And that means that I'm the @entity2 Prince! Being a prince is very special.I spend every morning walking around to see the zoo. It's better than any animal book. I say hello to the lions. I say woof at all of the wolves. I make faces to the penguins. Once I even gave a morning kiss to a bear! My favorite animal is the piggy. I named him @entity6. He likes to eat mustard, so I toss some mustard jars into his cage every morning. I do not know why that piggy likes mustard so much.Sometimes I walk around with the @entity0 and @entity2 Queen. Then we say hello to the animals together! I really like those days. Everybody who works at the @entity2 says hello to us when we walk by. At lunchtime, we all go to the @entity2 restaurant and eat pork chops. I hope @entity6 does not get mad about that!
