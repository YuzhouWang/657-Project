His parents were out and dropped him at the babysitter's house at @entity0 o'clock. @entity2 had past, but later the babysitter fixed him a dinner of some kind of brown meat. Under the meat was a slice of dry toast. @entity1 did not like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza. Even if it was not what he wanted, the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains.  @entity1 was bored and wanted something to do, but he did not have any toys. All he had was some paper, his toothbrush and toothpaste. He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train. The house was quiet and nighttime was near. He pretended he was camping. It was Eight o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain, making scary shadows on the wall.  He looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but could not find anything useful. If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures, but he did not even have a pencil. @entity1 thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat. He folded the paper into a mighty ship.   In his imagination the little boat was in a storm on a dark sea. @entity3 was all around. The imaginary men on his paper boat were facing the storm bravely and sailed into safety as he was falling asleep.
