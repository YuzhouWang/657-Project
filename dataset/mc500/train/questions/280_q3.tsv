@entity1's uncle @entity2 gave him and his brother, @entity3, some chalk to play with. @entity1 was a pretty good artist. His family said that all of his drawings looked real. His brother was sad that he was not as good at art and drawing as @entity1. @entity3 teased @entity1 to take his mind off the fact that he was not as good at art. He called @entity1 names and pretended to be a monster to scare @entity1 when he was not paying attention. When their mother gave them some chocolate as a treat, @entity3 took all of it and would not let @entity1 have any. @entity0 finally saw that @entity3 was hurting his brother, so he sat down to talk to him. After lots of questioning, @entity3 told his uncle the truth. "Instead of teasing your brother," @entity0 said, "why do not you ask him to teach you how to draw some things? He's used to his big brother knowing everything. I think he would like to teach you some things." @entity3 looked at the ground and finally said, "Okay." @entity1 was pleased that his brother asked him to teach him. After that, both boys got along much better.
