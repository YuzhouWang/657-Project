The turtle and the fox were best friends.  One day @entity0 wanted to find @entity1 and ask if he would come fishing with him.  @entity0 went to foxes house.  @entity1 was not home.  @entity0 went to look for @entity1.  @entity1 lived near several friends.  @entity0 went to @entity2's house first.  @entity2 lived next door to @entity1.  @entity2 answered the door, but @entity1 was not there.  @entity0 went to @entity5's house next.  @entity5 lived next door to @entity2.  @entity5 answered the door, but @entity1 was not there.  @entity0 went to @entity3's house next. @entity3 answered the door, but @entity1 was not there. Finally, @entity0 stopped at @entity4's house.  @entity4 was not home, and @entity1 was not there.  @entity0 was sad because he wanted to go fishing with his friend.  He walked slowly toward the stream to go fishing by himself.  When he got to the stream, he found @entity1 and @entity4 were there.  They were fishing.  They asked @entity0 to join them.  @entity0 was very happy that he had found @entity1, and he joined them for a fun afternoon of fishing in the stream.
