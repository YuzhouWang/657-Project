Once upon a time there was a cowgirl named @entity0. @entity0 was the most beautiful cowgirl in all the land. She rode a beautiful horse. Her horse was brown. There are plenty of other horses. There are black horses, white horses, and red horses, but @entity0's brown horse was the only horse in the world. @entity0 lived in a beautiful house with her husband. Her husband's name was @entity3. @entity3 was a very good farmer. He grew tomatoes. His neighbor grew corn, potatoes, and bananas. His neighbor's name was @entity2. @entity2 had a son named @entity1 who played in @entity3's field. One day @entity1 fell and @entity3 almost ran him over with his horse. It was very scary. @entity1 was very careful when playing in the field. His dad told him never to play in the field again and he listened. @entity3 was very sorry for scaring him and sent him a basket of tomatoes.
