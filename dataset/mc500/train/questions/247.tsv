@entity1s cannot clap. However, one weekend a magic clown wiggled his nose and said a few magical words and a zebra could clap. This zebra lived in a zoo with many other zebras. This zebra's name was @entity0, @entity0 the @entity1. @entity0 was so excited that he could clap. He tried to clap as much as he could. He had trouble understanding when and what to clap. He would clap at things that were sad and things that were happy. He clapped when he was excited and when he was scared. He even clapped that he could clap. After a couple of weeks, his friend @entity2 was getting annoyed with @entity0. He said "@entity0, I know you like clapping but I am beginning to be annoyed by your clapping." @entity0 said he was sorry, but that @entity2 did not understand how special it was to be the first @entity1 that could clap. A few more weeks went by and the same Magical clown came by @entity0's zoo. He looked at @entity0, who was clapping his heart out, and wiggled his nose and said some different magical words. Suddenly, @entity0 could not clap any more. And that month was first and only time a zebra could clap.
