@entity1 was a young lady bug.  She always felt different from the lady bugs because her colors were reversed!  Instead of a red body and black spots she had a black body and red spots!  As you can imagine this left @entity1 feeling pretty lonely so she spent a lot of time flying around to all the different areas to find other ladybugs like her.  She loved to feel the wind in her wings as she flew.  She spent so much of her time flying around so she could fly longer and faster than another other lady bug.  She also loved flying so much because it gave her a feeling of being free.  One day when she was flying around she heard a loud scream for help!  She went as fast as she could towards the screams for help.  She saw another lady bug with a broken wing lying on the ground.  She knew the lady bug as @entity0."What happened?!" asked @entity1."I crashed into the tree flying home yesterday and I've been lost ever since.  I ca not fly because my wing is broken. Do you know the way back home?" asked @entity0"Do not worry @entity0, I know this area like the back of my wing I'll lead you home!" @entity1 said happily."Thank you so much!" @entity0 said happily.@entity1 led @entity0 straight home where he was given medicine to fix his broken wing.  She was rewarded a medal and called a hero.  As she enjoyed her medal she knew she did not need to find for any more ladybugs that looked like her.  She now knew that even with her different colors, she was still a lady bug like everyone else.
