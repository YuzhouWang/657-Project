@entity1 enjoys playing with his friends. On Friday, @entity1 went outside to play with two of his friends, @entity3 and @entity2. They played with a ball for some time, but then they got bored. @entity2 said that she wanted to climb a tree. @entity3 thought that they could see if their other friend @entity0 could play with them.The three of them went to find @entity0. They saw @entity0 in front of his house, but he said that he was busy and he could not play with them. @entity1 and @entity3 then thought that @entity2's idea was good. There was a large tree in the park. @entity1, @entity3, and @entity2 walked to the park together.When they got to the park, they were surprised by the size of the tree. It was much larger than they thought. At first, @entity1 was scared to climb the tree. But @entity3 and @entity2 told him that it would be fun, so he began to climb. When he had climbed the first few branches, he slipped and fell down. But he was not hurt. After that, the three friends thought that it was too dangerous to climb that tree. So they all went home.When @entity1 went home, his mother asked him what happened. She saw that his shirt was dirty. @entity1 explained about the tree. Then he changed into a different shirt, so that his mother could wash the dirty shirt.
