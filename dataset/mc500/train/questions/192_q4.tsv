@entity0 was stuck in the middle of the ocean after his boat crashed and sank. He was worried about his friend who'd been in the boat with him. He knew that his friend has his life jacket on, so he tried not to worry too much about him. @entity0 was in a small box that fell out of the boat and kept him out of the water, floating. @entity0 had never been to sea before and one would wonder if he would ever after such a scary thing that happened to him. He sat in the box for days with no food or water, in and out of sleep. Three days later he woke up and saw land. Finally a beach was in sight, @entity0 could go home.

Did @entity0 ever go home

yes
