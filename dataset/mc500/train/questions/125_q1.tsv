While walking in the park on Monday with my granddaughter @entity2, we saw an ice cream truck pull up on the street. "Can we get ice cream, @entity0?" asked @entity2. "Sure we can!" I answered. As we started heading up the hill to the truck, my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face. "@entity0, that bird almost made me fall down the hill!" Laughing at what was said, I answered, "If you fell you might have taken @entity0 down with you!" Once we reached the ice cream truck, @entity2 saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn, hotdogs, juice and soda. "@entity0, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?" she asked. "If that is what you want, you sure can!" I answered. We got our food and headed to the picnic table. On our way over we saw a child who @entity2 knew from her kindergarten class. "@entity0, may we go and say hello to @entity1?" "Let's go!" We made it over to where @entity1 and her family were sitting and @entity2 saw a bright blue butterfly. She did everything she could to try and catch that pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch. "That is okay", she said, "Butterflies need to be left out to fly free".  @entity1 asked @entity2 if she wanted to go over her house and play Barbies when we left the park, instead of going home. So we went over and the girls had a wonderful time and were both tired after a long day. We needed to get a good night's sleep to enjoy our camping trip tomorrow.
