@entity12's parents planned a family trip to @entity0!  This would be @entity12's first big vacation out of @entity11.  She loves to be on planes. The plane ride was fun and they landed in @entity3, @entity7.  They went to the @entity4 and the @entity1.  @entity12 even learned how to say hello in @entity6!  They ate delicious food.  Then they took a train to @entity8, @entity2.  They drank tea and toast and went to see art.  Then they took another plane to @entity13.  They went to the beach and ate delicious @entity9 food.  @entity9 food was her favorite so far.  A new friend taught her "Hola," which is hello in @entity9.  Finally, they went to @entity10.  They ate pasta and pizza and saw the Leaning Tower of @entity5.  Her mom took a funny picture of her pretending to hold the tower. She learned to say hello in @entity14, too.  @entity12 had such a fun time on her vacation.  She took a lot of pictures and then made a photo album to show to her friends at school.  @entity12 wants to go back to @entity0 one day.  She loves to travel and see new and different places.
