Last Saturday was the best day of @entity1's summer. After waking up at nine and turning on his lamp, @entity1 ran downstairs, counting the steps as he always did. There were always seven. At the bottom, he jumped over his dog Lucky who was licking himself clean. @entity1 took a bite of toast and a sip of the orange juice his mom @entity5 had left on the table for him before running outside to check the mail. Before he made it down the steps, he almost tripped on a big package waiting for him. It was here! @entity1's birthday present from his grandmother @entity4 had arrived. He brought it into the kitchen, where his dad @entity2 was waiting for him with a grin on his face. As @entity1 tore into the package, he found the greatest present he could have asked for. It was a huge water gun! @entity1 immediately filled it up and ran outside to begin playing. His neighbor @entity0 came outside with her water hose after eating her sandwich and the two got in a water fight! Soon, @entity1's dad came outside to play too! He brought @entity3 water balloons. Soon all five of @entity1's friends were playing in the water with each other. @entity1's water gun was the best toy out there. It worked by winding up the handle before firing the water. Soon it was evening and @entity1's dad was firing up the grill to cook hotdogs and hamburgers for @entity1's friends and their families.
