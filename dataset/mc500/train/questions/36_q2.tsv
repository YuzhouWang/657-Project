@entity0 was starting his first day of day care. He was a little nervous about meeting his new teacher and all of his new friends. When his mother dropped him off, he kissed her goodbye and sat down in the green seat that his teacher showed him. He looked around the room. There were a lot of other kids there. A baby sat in a high chair sucking on a blue pacifier. A kid about @entity0's age named @entity2 was drawing and tracing his hand on paper. A little girl named @entity3 raised her hand and asked the teacher if she could go to the toilet. The teacher walked her into the bathroom and then returned to the class. She started helping @entity0 get to know the other kids in the class. A little girl named @entity1 tapped @entity0 on the shoulder and gave him some candy. He took the pink candy from her and thanked her. @entity0 smiled and thought, "I'm going to like it here."
