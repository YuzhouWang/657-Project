When summertime came @entity6 the @entity9 made up his mind it was time to get his hair cut. He told all his friends that it was because he wanted a new look. But the truth was the @entity5 was too hot for @entity6 the @entity9. His long hair only made it worse. So he left his home by @entity3 and went into town to visit the Edward the Barber at his barbershop. It was fun getting his hair cut, and when it was done @entity6 the @entity8 felt fresh and cool. "Your friends will not even know it's you, @entity6!" said Edward the Barber as @entity6 the @entity9 headed out the door. On the way back home, he took a short cut through the forest, and he met three people who were his friends. First he met @entity4 the Chief of Police, who was doing an important case. @entity6 said "Hello, @entity4!" but @entity4 ignored him. The second person he met was @entity0 the @entity2, who was delivering delicious treats. @entity6 said "Howdy, @entity0!" but @entity0 did not say anything back. The third person @entity6 met was @entity1 the @entity7, who was looking for a book he had lost. @entity6 said "Hey, @entity1!" but @entity1 did not stop looking for his book. "That's odd," thought @entity6 to himself, as he arrived home. "Why did all of my friends ignore me today?" Then he looked in the mirror and saw why. He looked like a totally different person. His friends must not have even known it was him!
