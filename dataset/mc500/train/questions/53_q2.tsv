@entity0 took his family to the lake. There are a lot of things to do at the lake. @entity0's favorite thing to do is ride in his red boat across the blue water. The boat is very loud and makes dark brown smoke. The boat can go very fast.  @entity0 has a son named @entity3. @entity3 does not like riding in the boat, he prefers to sit on the shore and make lunch. He makes sandwiches for the whole family. @entity3 loves eating ham sandwiches, but @entity0 prefers turkey sandwiches.  @entity3's mom also likes to eat ham sandwiches.  @entity3 also has a younger sister named @entity2. @entity2 does not like eating sandwiches so she brings one cup of soup and some chips for her lunch.  @entity2 enjoys fishing at the lake.  She caught two yellow fish, five pink fish and three blue fish.  @entity2 wants to cook the fish for dinner.  @entity3's mom likes to wear her favorite orange hat.  Her hat also has a big purple flower on top. She got the hat from @entity1 who works at the big store down the street.  After @entity0's family leaves the lake they all want to go home and eat dinner. Playing at the lake makes them all very hungry!
