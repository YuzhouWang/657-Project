She spends a lot of time lying on the grass, looking at the sky, and listening to the birds.One of @entity0's favorite things to do is to look at the shapes of the big, fluffy clouds. "That one looks like a flower. And that one looks like a boat. There's one that looks like my dog!" she says to herself. She is always surprised and happy to find a new shape.@entity0's most favorite thing to do is to look at the flowers and bugs that visit her place. She watches and studies all the butterflies, bees, ants, spiders, and even worms that are in her backyard.@entity0 has a wonderful backyard. Her mother has a big, beautiful garden that she helps to take care of. This is how @entity0 is learning to grow and take care of plants. The garden makes the whole yard look beautiful and smell wonderful. And the garden brings in all kinds of amazing birds and insects.@entity0 has lots of pictures of the birds and bugs that come into her backyard. She feels like a kid scientist.
