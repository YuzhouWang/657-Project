There once was a giant orange farm in space. No human had ever been there before. It could not be reached by plane, spaceship, car, or any other means of travel. The farm was run by large squirrels, and was started in 103Two. They owned the planet the farm was on, called @entity0. In the year Two03Seven, one brave man named @entity1 wanted to travel to @entity0 to see the farm. On @entity4, it was known the squirrels grew better oranges than any other animal, including rabbits, dogs, and horses. @entity1 wanted to learn the squirrels' secrets and bring them back to @entity4. @entity1 was no normal man. He could sneeze so hard that it would send him flying into the air. @entity1 put on a squirrel costume, and had his friend @entity2 tickle his nose for Seven hours. @entity1 sneezed so hard he flew into space and landed in @entity0. The squirrels did not know he was a human because of his costume. @entity1 met @entity5 and @entity3, Two of the most power squirrels in space. He told them his name was @entity6, and that he was sent by the squirrel king from @entity0's moon Rebeti to help them grow even more oranges. @entity5 and @entity3 told him all their secrets. @entity1 wrote all of them down, then sneezed so hard he went back to @entity4! With his help, @entity4 has now become the best place to grow oranges.
