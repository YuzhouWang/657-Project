@entity4, @entity5 and @entity1 were planning a birthday party for their friend @entity3. This party was going to be a surprise. They were going to have the party in @entity3's house. @entity4's job was making the house look nice. @entity5's job was to get a clown to come to the party. @entity1's job was to make enough food for all of the guests. Also, each of the three friends got @entity3 a gift.  @entity4 got @entity3 a few goldfish in a bowl. @entity5 got @entity3 a really cool little tree in a pot.  @entity1 got @entity3 a new shirt with people from @entity3's favorite television show on it. His favorite television show is @entity2, by the way. On the day of the party, @entity4 was taping signs on the walls, @entity5 was on the phone with the clown and @entity1 was cooking in the kitchen. There was a storm outside, so they were worried that all their friends might not show up. There was thunder and lightning, wind and rain. They even lost power for a little bit! But everything turned out okay in the end. All their friends showed up and @entity3 was very surprised. He loved all of his gifts and he thought the clown was funny. @entity0 loved the food @entity1 made, too.
