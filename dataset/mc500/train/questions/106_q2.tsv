A man named @entity0 lived in a small town in the state of @entity1.  @entity0 owned a sheep farm.  His favorite time of year was when lambs were born.  They were very cute.  @entity0 also had other animals on his farm, such as pigs, dogs, cats, and cows.  One day @entity0 wanted to paint his barn.  He could not find his ladder.  He looked in the barn, in his house, in his garage, and in his field.  Since he could not find it he had to stand on a table.  It took @entity0 six days to paint his barn that way.  @entity0's favorite activity was to sit on his porch and sip lemonade.  He would watch the clouds float by in the sky.  He thought they looked a lot like his sheep.  Every night when @entity0 went to sleep, he would listen to the sound of the wind blowing across the fields on his farm.  He would dream about feeding his sheep.
