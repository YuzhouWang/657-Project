@entity3 and @entity1 went to their @entity0's house to visit on Saturday morning. She had some new ducklings in the pond that they wanted to see.  They went out to the pond and on the way they saw a frog.  They also saw a boat in the water.  They saw a water lily. They looked in the water until they saw the mother duck and her ducklings.  They were different colors.  Six of them were brown and yellow. Four of them were only yellow.  Two ducklings were brown.  There was one that was white. They were all very fuzzy.   They went back to the house to tell @entity0 Beth about the ducklings.  She was cooking on the stove.  She asked @entity1 to get some eggs.  She asked @entity3 to get some butter. @entity0 Beth poured some milk into a bowl of flour. She made them a cake.  "I'm so glad you've come to visit me," @entity0 Beth said.  @entity1 told her about the things they saw at the pond.  @entity3 said, "We saw a frog.  Do not forget the frog. It was my favorite."  It was a good visit.
