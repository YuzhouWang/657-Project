One day, a boy named @entity0 wanted take a trip on his red tricycle. He was not sure where he wanted to go, but he knew he wanted to go somewhere far away.  It was a cloudy and chilly day, so @entity0 wore a warm shirt.  @entity0 worried that he might get lonely on his trip.  He borrowed his mother's phone and taped it to the handle bars of his tricycle so he could call home. He also put his music player in his pocket. @entity0 put some left over pizza in his backpack in case he got hungry. @entity0 pedaled down his driveway, heading out on his big trip. When he got to the end of his driveway, Mrs. Jones, his teacher from school, was walking by on the sidewalk. "Hello @entity0", said Mrs. Jones, "Where are you going on that nice red tricycle?" "I'm going on a trip to someplace far away" said @entity0. Mrs. Jones smiled, and thought for a second. "Make sure you are back by morning, we have a field trip tomorrow", said Mrs. Jones.  @entity0 had been waiting for the field trip for weeks. He looked at Mrs. Jones and said, "I think I'll wait to take a trip until I can fly. I do not want to miss the field trip and this tricycle is not very fast."
