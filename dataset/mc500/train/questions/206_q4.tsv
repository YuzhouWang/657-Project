Once there was a boy named @entity1 who loved to draw. He drew everything. In the morning, he drew a picture of his cereal with milk. His papa said, "Do not draw your cereal. Eat it!" After school, @entity1 drew a picture of his bicycle. His uncle said, "Do not draw your bicycle. Ride it!" At nighttime, after he finished washing his face, he drew a picture of the toothpaste on the sink. His mama said, "Do not draw the toothpaste. @entity2 your teeth!"  One day @entity1 got a splinter in his foot. It hurt. He wanted to take the splinter out. But first, he drew a picture of his foot with the splinter in it. He said, "Now I can remember what my foot looks like with a splinter in it." Then he took the splinter out all by himself. He told his friend @entity0 that he took the splinter out all by himself. @entity0 did not believe him. @entity1 showed him the picture. Then @entity0 believed him.
