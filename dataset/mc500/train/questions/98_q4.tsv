@entity2 was an alligator that loved to splash around in the water. @entity2 had three brothers, named @entity3, @entity1, and @entity0. But none of @entity2's three brothers liked to play in the water. They were very mean brothers, but the meanest of them all was @entity3. @entity3 would always chase @entity2 around the lake and try to beat him up when he was splashing around. Then on his birthday, @entity2 thought of a great idea. His idea was to stop @entity3 from beating him by using a trick. He would trick @entity3 into thinking one side of the lake was scary. @entity2 dressed up in a spooky costume and waited for @entity3 to swim over to the side of the lake. Then when @entity3 came over, @entity2 started making spooky sounds and scared @entity3 back to the other side of the lake. @entity3 was so scared he never came to the other side of the lake again and @entity2 was free to splash around in peace.
