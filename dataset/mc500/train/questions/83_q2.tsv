@entity1 waited for his granddaddy to show up. They were going fishing. His mom had packed them a lunch. She had made @entity5 and @entity0 Sandwiches. She also packed a bottle of nice cool water to drink. @entity1 had wanted something else for lunch. He wanted chicken or cold cuts or left over meat loaf, but his mom sent @entity5 and @entity0 sandwiches. The best way to get to the river was along the path. When the path ended, they needed to go through the bushes to the river. On some days they would think about going another way. They could go over the bridge, or through the back of the house or through @entity4's yard. Today they took the path to the river. @entity1 found some animal poop along the path. He asked his @entity2 what kind of animal poop he had found. He wanted to know if it was a lion, a tiger or a bear that had made the poop. @entity2 pointed in the bushes. @entity1 saw a small black and white animal looking at him with big eyes. @entity1 knew that he had was looking at a raccoon. He was sure that the raccoon had made the poop. When @entity1 and @entity2 got to the river they put their fishing poles into the water. @entity1 caught his first fish right away. He caught a second fish before lunch. He got hungry and had his @entity5 and @entity0 sandwich and cool water. He saw that @entity2 had fallen asleep. After eating his lunch, @entity1 caught three more fish before he woke up his grandpa. When @entity1 and @entity2 got back home they gave all the fish they had caught to @entity1's mother, so she could make a good dinner.
