@entity1 woke up from his nap. He had finished eating all the delicious food on the table that @entity4 had made for him and he was tired. With a laugh, @entity1 looked at the green balloon that his daughter @entity4 had put over his head to float. @entity0 the dog walked into the room where @entity1 was sitting and made a noise. @entity0 barked.  @entity1 looked at @entity0 and smiled, and then grabbed his brown hat from the table. Next to his hat there was a picture of a rainbow that @entity4 had drawn for @entity1. It was a pretty rainbow. @entity2 the cat walked in on @entity0 with his barking and @entity1 with his hat in hand and then meowed. @entity2 and @entity0 looked at each other. @entity1, seeing the two looking at each other, made the choice that enough was enough and opened the door to walk outside. @entity4 was standing outside the house on the lawn, and with a yell, she surprised @entity1! With a wave of her hand, she showed him the duck that she was watching. @entity4 gave the duck the name @entity3, and @entity1 was pleased. He and @entity4 watched @entity3 walk away and they saw a real rainbow in the distance. It was a beautiful start to the day. Bluebird the blue bird was flying high in the sky, and @entity1 smiled. In the distance, he saw a white airplane.
