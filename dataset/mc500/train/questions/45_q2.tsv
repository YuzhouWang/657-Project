It was a rainy day and @entity0 wanted to play. If he went outside to play, he would get wet. @entity0' mother told him not to get wet because he might catch a cold. @entity0 went out to play, anyway.Outside, the cool rain kept falling. There were no other children for @entity0 to play with. The other children were all playing inside, where it was warm and dry. @entity0 found a puddle that had appeared in the mud. He found a piece of wood and pretended it was a turtle. He put the wooden turtle in the puddle and watched it float in a circle. This was not very fun. After one hour, @entity0 went back inside.When @entity0 went inside, he found his mother waiting. She had her hands on her hips and a serious look on her face. @entity0 was soaking wet! His mother made him change into dry clothes, and he was not to leave the house for the rest of the day.The next morning, the sun shone warm and bright, and the birds sang their morning songs. It was a beautiful day. When @entity0 woke up, he coughed. Then he sneezed. His body ached all over. @entity0 had a cold!@entity0 looked out the window and saw the neighbor children playing in their yards. They were having a lot of fun. @entity0 wanted to join them, but he was too sick. His mother was right.
