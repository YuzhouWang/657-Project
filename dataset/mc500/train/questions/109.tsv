There once was a pumpkin.  The pumpkin was sad.   The pumpkin wanted to leave the garden and see the world.  But the pumpkin had to stay in the garden because its vine held it there.  One day a fox came by.  The pumpkin asked the fox to cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden.  The fox said it would cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden.  When the fox cut the vine the pumpkin could roll around.  The pumpkin rolled around until it got out of the garden.  First it met a cat.  It told the cat it was happy because now it could see the world.  The cat gave the pumpkin a piece of cake to eat.  The pumpkin could not eat the cake because it had no mouth but it was still very happy to have the cat as a new friend.
