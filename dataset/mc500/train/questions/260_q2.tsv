One Saturday afternoon about the second week of May, @entity0 and her mom @entity1 went to the dentist. @entity0 was seven years old and she was scared of the dentist, but her mom promised to fix her favorite chicken dish for dinner if @entity0 was a good girl. "At least it's not the doctor's!" she said. They got to the dentist office and @entity1 told the woman, named @entity2, at the front desk that they were there. There were lots of toys in the waiting room but @entity0 was too nervous to enjoy them like the other kids. Finally, a woman came and told @entity0 and @entity1 that it was @entity0's turn. They made a right turn and went to the third room on the left. @entity0 sat down in the dentist's chair. A woman, Mary, came in and cleaned her teeth and told @entity0 and @entity1 that @entity0 had done well with her brushing. Then the dentist, @entity3, came in and did a checkup. He saw that everything was good and that @entity0 had no problems with her teeth. He gave @entity0 a bag with a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a sugar free candy. There was also a smiley face sticker in the bag. @entity1 was proud of her daughter and stopped at the grocery store to get ingredients for the chicken dish for dinner as promised.
