It was Saturday, and every Saturday all the children on the block would have a bicycle race. @entity0 rode his new red bicycle to the dead end street where the race was held. He knew he would win. His new bicycle would be faster than anyone's. @entity2 was there on her white bicycle. @entity3 was riding a blue bicycle, and @entity1 soon arrived on a yellow bicycle. The race began, and @entity0 was in the lead. He heard @entity2 crying behind him. He turned to see her chain was broken, and she had fallen from her bike into the green grass. @entity0 stopped and turned around to help @entity2. @entity1 and @entity3 rode past them, and it was soon clear that @entity3 would win the race. @entity0 walked @entity2 home, and she thanked him for being a good friend.
