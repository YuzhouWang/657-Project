Once there was a dog named @entity2. @entity2 had two brothers named @entity5 and @entity1, and a sister named @entity0. @entity2's best friend was a boy named @entity4. @entity4 went to school, but the dogs stayed home all day. @entity4 liked to feed @entity2 chicken and beef. One day @entity4 went to the store and bought chicken for @entity2. @entity4 put too much chicken in @entity2's bowl. @entity2 ate up all the chicken, but then his belly hurt. Poor @entity2! @entity4 was sad that he had made @entity2 feel sick. @entity4 took @entity2, @entity5, and @entity1 to the park to run and play. @entity0 stayed home because she was sick. There were so many things to see at the park. @entity5 found a little red ladybug. @entity1 found a big gray mouse. @entity2 found a long brown stick. @entity4 found a deep pond with three ducks in it. @entity3 had a great day at the park. Then the three dogs and @entity4 all went back home. When they got home, @entity0 was asleep on the bed. @entity0 said she was feeling better. @entity4 brought @entity0 some chicken noodle soup to eat. @entity2, @entity5, and @entity1 sat on the bed with @entity0 eating bones and drinking milk.
