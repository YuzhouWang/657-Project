@entity0 was playing with his toy airplane in the backyard after school one day when he saw something moving in the corner of the yard. He put down his toy and went over to look. He found a small frog, about two inches cross, jumping across the grass. Carefully, @entity0 followed the frog as it jumped across the grass. He did not know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs needed water. He wanted to help the frog. He ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand. He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard. It took him some time to find the frog again. It seemed to be moving slower than it had before. He waited for it to pause, then scooped it up with his bare hands and dropped it into the water. He watched the frog swim around for a bit, and then carried the pail around to the front of the house. It was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood. @entity0 walked slowly, trying not to spill the water. The pail seemed to grow heavier and heavier as he walked. Finally, he reached the creek. He set the pail down next to the water and tipped it over until the frog was swimming in the stream.
