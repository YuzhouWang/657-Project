@entity0 loves cats.  He owns Eight cats.  He has Seven girl cats and only One boy cat.  @entity0 brushes the cats' hair every day.  He makes sure to feed them every morning and evening and always checks to see if the cats have water.  Sometimes he feeds them special treats because he loves them.    Each cat gets Three treats.  He does not give them food like chips and cake and candy, because those foods are not good for cats.  He likes to play with the cats.  The cats like to chase balls of paper that @entity0 makes for them.   Some of his cats have orange fur, some have black fur, some are spotted and one is white.  The white cat is @entity0's favorite.  She is the first cat he owned.  Her name is Snowball.  When he first got Snowball she was a kitten.  His other cats are named @entity1, @entity4, @entity3, @entity7, @entity5, @entity6 and @entity2.
