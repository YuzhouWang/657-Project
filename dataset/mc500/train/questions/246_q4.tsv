One day a young princess named @entity1 was looking out of the window of her castle. @entity1 loved to sing, but was tired of singing only the songs her mother, @entity2, allowed her to sing. Princess @entity1 thought it might be fun to write her own songs instead.So, on Saturday Princess @entity1 went to the garden with a pen and paper. She thought and thought, but could not come up with any words for a song. What could she write about? @entity3, her cow? Her frog, @entity0?Nothing came to mind. She sat there all day. And the next day too. @entity1 was tired and hungry. But she wanted to stay until she had a song. Finally, on Monday, @entity2 came looking for @entity1 and forced her to return to her room. She gave @entity1 a large book of songs to sing. @entity1 was happy.
