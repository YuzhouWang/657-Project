I could not believe today had come! It was finally my birthday and that meant I could start working at the nearby pet store. First off, let me say that my name is @entity2, and as I'm sure you know, today's my birthday! Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me. Some people dream of being a doctor, or a nurse, or even a teacher, but I've always wanted to work with pets. I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I wo not get to take care of them!I arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone. Her hair was covering her name tag so I could not tell if her name was @entity0, @entity1, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was @entity3 so none of them were right. @entity3 helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day. I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them! @entity3 did not think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day. It was everything I ever hoped and I ca not wait for tomorrow!
