The chipmunks were busy getting ready for the winter.  @entity0 had never seen everyone so busy.  Chipmunks were running this way and that way.  Even his @entity3 was helping out, stuffing melons up into the holes in the tree.  @entity1 was clapping at everyone to hurry them up.  @entity0 was not sure what they were all doing.  His mom had told him, "Getting ready for winter" but @entity0 did not know what that meant.  He sat on the seesaw trying to guess.  He knew that people were gathering things.  Now that he thought about it, they were gathering food!  @entity0 thought for a second...could they be gathering food for a party?  That could not be it, everyone was gathering so much food that not every chipmunk in the town could come close to eating all the food for a single party.  @entity0 looked at his big toe and thought.  He saw another chipmunk digging in the ground and stuffing more food there.  Was the guy trying to plant seeds to grow?  Seeds would not grow in the winter, it's too cold!  @entity0 sat up and knew why everyone was so busy! @entity2 is coming!
