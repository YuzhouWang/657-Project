@entity1 was a little barn mouse and loved to sleep on a blanket. Every day in the morning, @entity1 would wake up and fold his little blue blanket that he slept on. @entity1's uncle @entity0 got the blanket for @entity1 from in the big house. @entity1 loved this blanket more than any other thing he had. @entity1 had a lot of neat stuff. He had a penny, a safety pin and an earring. He found all of these when he would walk through the forest in the afternoon. @entity1's uncle @entity0 would always take walks with him through the forest, to make sure that @entity1 did not get in any trouble. @entity1 had to be careful that people did not see him, because the people did not like mice. @entity1 did not understand, because people liked other animals, but would scream if they saw a mouse. They did not scream if they saw a dog, cat or chicken. @entity1 thought the dogs were the scariest and people might rather scream when they saw dogs and not mice.

@placeholder was @entity1's favorite thing
