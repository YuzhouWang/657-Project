@entity1 was helping her little brother @entity0 pick flowers from the garden. They wanted to put the flowers in a jar to put on the kitchen table. @entity2's Day was the next day and their mother loved fresh flowers. After they picked flowers and put them in a jar, @entity0 asked @entity1 if they could have a snack. @entity1 took @entity0 into the kitchen and got out an apple to slice up. They sat down at the table looking at the flowers and ate their apple slices. There was a window in the kitchen that let in sunlight. "Hey!" @entity0 said, pointing at one of the roses in the jar. "There's something moving on that rose." @entity1 looked more closely at the flowers. "It's a ladybug," she said. "We need to take it back outside." Suddenly the ladybug began flying around the kitchen. @entity0 jumped up and ran around trying to catch it. At last he clapped his hands around it. "Careful!" said @entity1. @entity0 walked outside and let the ladybug go.
