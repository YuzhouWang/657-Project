"Hey! That is not fair! Knights ca not fly! Only wizards like me can! And maybe also witches." @entity0 yelled. "Yes! They can, too!" @entity1 said, "They're the most powerful and you ca not stop me from flying!" "Well, if you fly, then I can fight with a sword, too. It's only fair," @entity0 said back. "No! They ca not! They are not even strong enough to pick up a sword. They ca not even pick up a knife, they're so weak! I do not even know what you're talking about. You're crazy, are not you?" @entity1 pointed his finger at @entity0 and ran at him with the sword made out of cardboard. @entity0 jumped out of the way as quickly as he could! @entity0 then pointed a finger at @entity1. "@entity2!" @entity1 stopped in place. "Hey, you ca not use the freeze spell. How can I fight you if I ca not move? I'm going to tell mom." "I can use any spell I want! I can use @entity5, @entity3, and Fly! I can do any of them!  I'm also telling mom that you think you can fly and you ca not. You're a stupid knight with no brains. I have all the brains here." @entity0 crossed his arms over his chest and stomped a foot on the ground. "You take that back! I'm the smartest knight there is and I'll get you any day!" Suddenly, @entity1 pulled @entity0 to the ground. "Take it back right now!" "BOYS! What's all the noise?" @entity4 asked. "@entity0 called me stupid!" @entity1 yelled. "@entity1 is trying to fly!" @entity0 cried. "Oh boy." @entity4 laughed.
