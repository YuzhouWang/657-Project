@entity2 wanted to bake a cake for her best friend @entity0's birthday. @entity2 called her friend @entity1 saying that she needed @entity1's help to make the cake. @entity1 wanted to bake cookies and cupcakes too. @entity2 said that was okay and to buy everything. @entity1 went to the store and bought everything. @entity1 went to @entity2's house and they started to make the cake. After baking the cake, they started making cookies and cupcakes. The house smelled great. They had a lot of fun baking. After cleaning up, they called @entity0 to come over to @entity2's house and surprise her for her birthday. @entity0 was surprised and so was their friend @entity3. The girls ate the cake and snacked on the cookies and cupcakes. The ladies laughed and talked as they ate. After eating, they watched a movie on @entity2's TV. It was a good movie and the ladies all laughed and talked about it after. @entity0 and @entity3 left @entity2's house to go home. @entity1 and @entity2 said bye and had big smiles. It was a great day, and @entity2 was happy.
