One day, my dog woke up early and would not go back to sleep. Why did the dog wake up early? I tried really hard to find out. "Are you sick, dog?" I asked. He did not say anything, so I took his temperature. It said he was not sick! "Are you hungry, dog?" He did not say anything, so I feed him some dog food. He did not eat it! "Are you thirsty, dog?" He did not say anything, so I gave him some water. He did not drink it! "What's wrong, dog?" He wagged and wagged his tail, and then went over to a bag of balloons that I had. He poked them with his nose. "Oh!" I said. I went over to the balloons and took one out of the bag. I blew it up. He wagged his tail harder. "Is it your birthday, dog?" He wagged and wagged. It must be his birthday! I baked him a bright yellow cake and blew up more balloons. I played his favorite music. We had a party. It was so much fun!
