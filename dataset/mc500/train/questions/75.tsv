@entity1's First Flight@entity1 was a little baby bird who was born only Six weeks before.  Her mother took care of her and her brothers and sister by feeding them bugs and worms.  @entity1 had Two brothers.  She also had one sister.  During this time, @entity1 grew and grew and got stronger and stronger.  Her feathers got longer, too.  The day had finally come when mother bird told @entity1 and her brothers and sister that they would be learning to fly for the first time.  @entity0 of joy were heard from all the baby birds.  All except for @entity1.  She was too afraid to fly out into the world.  She wanted to stay in her comfy nest with all of her family for the rest of her life.  She also wanted her mother to feed her for the rest of her life. @entity2 bird told @entity1 how exciting it was to fly and see all the beautiful flowers and trees and told her she would help her learn like she did when she was a baby bird. She told her that she would meet lots of other bird friends, too. So @entity1 tried not to be scared, even as she saw both of her brothers and sister fly off the nest and out into the world.  They looked so happy.  Then it was her turn.  She spread her wings, closed her eyes and jumped out of the nest.  After a few seconds, she opened her eyes to see that she was actually flying.  Oh happy day!  It was everything her mother said it would be.  The world looked so big and @entity1 could not wait to see it all.
