One beautiful day, there was a watermelon.  This watermelon was sitting on a bench.  The bench was on the grass.  The grass was in the park.  It was a beautiful place.  But @entity1 had a problem.  It was bored.  All of its friends were busy!"I'm so bored!" cried @entity1."Come talk to me!" answered a voice from the park."But who are you?  Where are you?" asked the watermelon."I am a rock.  I am behind you."@entity1 turned around.  Off in the distance, it saw the rock."But @entity4, you are so far away!  Can you come closer?""No, I ca not.  I am a rock.  I am big and flat and heavy.  I am not round like you.  I ca not roll to join my friends.  I ca not play with everyone like you can.  My shape is no good.  No good at all.  But I want to play!  I want to talk!""That is a very sad story, @entity4.  But what can I do?""Can you roll?""Well, yes, yes I can.""Then roll over here!"And so @entity1 did.  They talked for a long time.  They sang songs.  They played games.  It was so much fun that @entity1 did not see the weather was changing.  Suddenly a strong wind blew, and it pushed @entity1 away."@entity2!  @entity2!  I am rolling away, help!""Quick, @entity1!  @entity0 behind me!"  @entity4 was afraid for his new friend.@entity1 rolled behind @entity4, and there it was protected by @entity4 from the dangerous wind."You saved me!  @entity3 you""No problem!""You may be big and flat and heavy.  And maybe you ca not roll around like me.  But I am very happy because of that!  I am safe because you are what you are!"
