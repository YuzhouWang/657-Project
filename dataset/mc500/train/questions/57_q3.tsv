@entity1 was the best baseball player in his neighborhood. He also enjoyed playing basketball, but he was not very good at it. Every morning he would get up and go out to the baseball field, and every night he would dream about his favorite players. He loved the @entity5, and knew he would someday play for them. One day when @entity1 was practicing at the field, a man in a nice suit came out of a long car and walked over to @entity1. The man said that he worked for the @entity5, and was there to see @entity1 play! @entity1 was so excited he could scream! Knowing that the man was watching, he played the best game ever that day. When he was done, the man told @entity1 that he was good enough to play for the @entity5, and to pack his things right away. @entity1 hurried home as fast as he could, and started to pack up all his clothes. His mom walked in and asked what @entity1 was doing. "I'm going to play for the @entity5 ma!" @entity1 said. @entity1's mom was so excited that she took @entity1 and the whole family out for dinner. @entity2, @entity4, @entity3 and @entity0 were all there, and bought @entity1 a big cake! As @entity1 said goodbye to everyone, he could not help but feel sad that he would be gone for so long. "Do not worry son, we'll be at all the games cheering you on!" said his dad. This made @entity1 happy again, and as he left to be with his team, he knew that he had finally made it.
