There was once an alligator who liked to wear orange sweaters. He liked that is was orange instead of a boring color like white or black. All of the other alligators would laugh and point at him and say mean things about him. They would say it was silly for an alligator to wear a sweater. One night it got very cold and the ground was very hard. The alligator rested well with his sweater to keep his tummy warm and protected from the cold ground. After that night all of the alligators wore different colored sweaters (red, blue, green, and yellow) and were safe and warm from the cold weather. They thanked him and apologized for laughing before. The point of this story is that sometimes silly ideas turn out to be the best ideas and we should not make fun of others.

@placeholder did the other alligators do when they first saw the sweater before the cold night

laugh and point at him and say that "alligators in sweaters" is a silly idea.
