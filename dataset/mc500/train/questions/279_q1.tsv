One day, the mouse, @entity1, got a splinter in his paw when he was putting a new fence around his house. His turtle friend with a weird name, @entity0, came up to @entity1 after he heard him yelling, "Ouch, I've got a splinter in my paw! Can someone help?" @entity0, being the ever helpful turtle, took the splinter in his mouth and tugged it. The splinter popped right out of @entity1's paw and flew right into the air and then landed in the middle of the river.@entity1 looked happy and gave @entity0 a hug. "Thank you so much, @entity0! And for helping me, I'll give you the choice of one of these three desserts I found. What would you like to have? A cake? A cookie? Or maybe this brownie?""Oh, @entity1, you are so silly and know you do not even have to ask me which one I'd take. You know I love brownies!" @entity0 smiled happily as @entity1 gave him his treat and another hug for helping with the splinter.After the two friends finish their dessert, @entity0 helped @entity1 put up the rest of his fence until the sun went down that day. It was a good day for both friends.
