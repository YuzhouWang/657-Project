I once was walking in the woods with my friends. The day was very nice, there were a lot of trees. The walk was part of a week long trip I took with @entity0. This day was day number three of our trip. There was four of us walking. We were walking down a path when all of the sudden we came across a bear. This scared us. Bears can be dangerous. A few seconds later we saw another bear, there was not only one. This bear was a baby bear. A leader told us that a bear with a baby can be much more dangerous. We had to remember what to do when you come across a bear. The leader told us not to walk towards the bear. You also can not make any quick motions. The leader said we needed to start talking to make noise and to start to walk away from the bears. After a little bit of time we were away from the bears and we were safe.
