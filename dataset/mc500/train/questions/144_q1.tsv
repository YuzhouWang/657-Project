There was once an animal named @entity1. He was not a dog, a bunny or a bear but a little kitten. Unlike the black, white and orange cats in his neighborhood, @entity1 was a gray cat. He loved to go outside and run around the streets and the city. He liked to listen to the birds chirp and watch the children draw with chalk. He was a very smart and friendly kitten. @entity1 was good at many things. He was good at hopping, running and playing. The thing @entity1 was best at was climbing! His claws gripped trees hard which made it easy for him to pull himself up. @entity0 who saw @entity1 climb might think he was part monkey! @entity1 also loved his family. When he was not outside he liked to sit with people when they would read, play with toys and eat. @entity1 was a very lazy cat! He loved to sleep most of the day, at least Twelve hours! His family could always count on him to be sleepy.
