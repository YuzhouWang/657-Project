One day, @entity0 wanted to make a birthday cake for her brother, @entity2. She dug around in their white refrigerator and found she would need to go and buy eggs. She also needed to buy icing.  @entity0 got on her pink bike and went to the grocery store. She asked the cashier to tell her what aisle the icing was on. @entity0 went to the aisle Fourteen and picked out blue, @entity2's favorite color. She then went to get the eggs. @entity0 worked for Two hours making the cake. She decorated it in the blue icing, and even wrote "Happy Birthday @entity2" in neat letters. @entity0's parents made a nice dinner of chicken, red potatoes, and macaroni. After dinner, @entity0 and her mom and dad sang to @entity2. He was excited for the cake and to turn @entity1, and said @entity0 was the best sister ever.
