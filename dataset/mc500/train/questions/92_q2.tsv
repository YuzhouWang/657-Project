Tuesdays during the summer tickets are buy one get one free at the city zoo. @entity1 loves animals, so his dad takes him to the zoo every Tuesday in the summer. This Tuesday @entity1's dad is feeling sick so his mommy has to take him to the zoo. There is also a new animal that @entity1 ca not wait to see; a rattle snake. Tuesday morning @entity1's mommy wakes him up, and they get in the car to drive to the zoo. On the car ride @entity1's favorite song "The @entity0 on the Bus" plays on the radio. @entity1's mommy turns the radio louder and they sing the song together. When they get to the zoo they go straight to the rattle snake cage, but when they get there they do not see any rattle snakes. They look around for a little bit, and all they see are some eggs. A man who works at the zoo tells them that the rattle snake must be sleeping and that it hides when it sleeps. @entity1 is sad because he might not get to see the rattle snake today. They walk away from the rattle snake cage and @entity1's mommy buys @entity1 an ice cream cone to cheer him up. After walking around the zoo and seeing other animals like a bear and a monkey, @entity1 wants to check the rattle snake cage one more time. They get to the cage and to @entity1's surprise the rattle snake is awake and moving around. Not only does he get to see the snake, but a baby is being born from one of the eggs too. @entity1 is very happy and excited about what he saw in the rattle snake cage and ca not wait to get home and tell his dad.
