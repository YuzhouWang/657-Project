@entity0 had a very long finger. It was the longest finger anyone in his town had. One day @entity0 shut the toilet seat, and his finger got caught in it. He could not get it out. It was very cold in the bathroom. This is why his sister brought him a coat. He was in the bathroom a long time. So, @entity0 started pasting a stone on the wall with glue on the end of his brush. Then he wrote the truth on this stone. He used a black pencil to write the truth on this stone, but the writing turned out blue. He did not know that his sister was watching him write the truth from the ceiling. He was upset because he always had a fear that he would have to share his secret power with his sister. It was too late, she saw that he wrote the truth on the stone. So he let her see his power. With a twirl of his long finger he magically made the toilet seat lift up. He could make things move with his mind.
