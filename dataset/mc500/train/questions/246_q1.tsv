One day a young princess named @entity4 was looking out of the window of her castle. @entity4 loved to sing, but was tired of singing only the songs her mother, @entity1, allowed her to sing. Princess @entity4 thought it might be fun to write her own songs instead. So, on Saturday Princess @entity4 went to the garden with a pen and paper. She thought and thought, but could not come up with any words for a song. What could she write about? @entity2, her cow? Her frog, @entity0? @entity3 came to mind. She sat there all day. And the next day too. @entity4 was tired and hungry. But she wanted to stay until she had a song. Finally, on Monday, @entity1 came looking for @entity4 and forced her to return to her room.  She gave @entity4 a large book of songs to sing. @entity4 was happy.
