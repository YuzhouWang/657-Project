@entity1 was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon @entity1 was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when @entity3 came to fetch her for her bath.  @entity1 did not like baths very much and she ran away every time @entity3 got close to her.  @entity3 soon got tired of @entity1's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed @entity3 and @entity1 was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped @entity3 would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, @entity1 was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with @entity7, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with @entity1 laid down to take a nap.A little later @entity3 came back out into the yard to fetch @entity1.   What @entity3 did not know was, @entity1 had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  @entity1 took off running as soon as she saw @entity3.   @entity3 sat down on the grass to wait.  @entity3 found a ball and started to throw it for @entity1 to fetch.  @entity3 kept on throwing the ball and @entity1 kept on bringing it back until  @entity1 dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out.      @entity3 quickly slipped the collar and leash on her.   @entity3 got @entity1 on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine.   @entity3's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but @entity3 said no, he'd rather get @entity1's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   @entity3 knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and @entity4 would finish the @entity2 ice cream which was @entity3's favorite.@entity3 tied @entity1's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  @entity1   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let @entity3 soak her.   @entity3 quickly added soap to @entity1's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon @entity3 once again turned the hose on @entity1 to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub @entity1 down with a towel and dry her offOnce @entity3 had finished he took the collar and leash off and @entity1 lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   @entity3 went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between @entity5, @entity6, @entity0 and @entity8 or @entity2 ice cream. @entity3 quickly said he wanted the @entity2 and his father put down a large dish of the ice cream and said 'good job son'
