@entity1 really wanted a pet dog, so he went to ask his parents."Mom, @entity0, can I we get a dog?"@entity1's mom and dad thought about this, and then answered him. "Having a pet can be a lot of work, @entity1. When you own a dog, you have to feed him, and take him for walks, and clean up after him. You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV. If you promise to help take care of him, we'll get a dog."@entity1 was very happy to hear this! The next weekend, his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept. It was very noisy inside! @entity1 looked at a big yellow dog first. "This dog is pretty big, @entity1," his father said. "He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have."  @entity1 thought that @entity0 was right about that. The next dog @entity1 looked at was a very small white dog. It barked over and over again as @entity1 and his mother looked at it."This dog is very noisy @entity1. He might need a lot of attention from you. Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention?"@entity1 was not sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy. Finally @entity1 looked at a third dog, a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog, but smaller than the yellow one. The dog came over to @entity1 right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over."Do you like the brown dog?" asked @entity1's dad."Yes!" said @entity1. "Can we get him?""Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school?" asked @entity1's mom."I promise," said @entity1."In that case, I guess we have a dog!"This made @entity1 very happy.
