@entity0 and her friend @entity1 liked to play hide and go seek in the woods.  They would almost always play in the woods behind @entity0's house. They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime. One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at @entity0's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. @entity1 counted to fifty to give @entity0 time to hide. In the middle of counting, @entity1 heard a sound! @entity1 opened up her eyes to see @entity0 had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to @entity0's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to @entity0's front door, @entity0's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy. The puppy ran over to @entity0's neighbor and licked her face. The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill. The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!
