@entity3 was a cowboy. He and his horse, @entity2, lived by the @entity1. The @entity1 was as clear as a mirror. One day, @entity3 was riding @entity2 along the shore when he saw a fire in the distance. "Wow," @entity3 said. "I wonder why there's a fire."@entity3 and @entity2 went to see. The fire was deep in the hills, and it took a long time to get there. By the time they arrived, it was almost supper time. The fire was a campfire. There was a little girl at the fire. She was drawing pictures with crayons."Hello," @entity3 said. "What are you doing in the hills?""I'm @entity0," the girl said. "I'm camping, but my tent got blown away by the wind. So I'm sitting by the fire and drawing pictures.""What are you drawing?""I'm finishing up this drawing of a dragon," she said. Then she pointed at two drawings on the ground next to her. They were held in place with pebbles. "This is an elf," she said. "And this is a pony.""They're very pretty," @entity3 said. "I'm @entity3, and this is @entity2.""Pleased to meet you," @entity0 said. "Would you like to draw with me? We can do a drawing of @entity2 together.""That would be fun," @entity3 said.And so they sat down and drew a picture of @entity2 together.
