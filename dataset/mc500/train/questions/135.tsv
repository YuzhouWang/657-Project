@entity6 is my best friend's birthday and I do not know what to get him. He's eleven years old like me, and to be honest, everyone likes to always mix us up. It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike, but it's our names, @entity3 and @entity4, that do it. Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.My mom took me to the store and I looked around for something @entity4 would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to @entity4 on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, @entity5, @entity0, and @entity1. Sadly our other friend, @entity2 could not make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together.
