It's finally the weekend of @entity1 and I get to dress up in my lion costume.  @entity1 is my favorite holiday because I really like candy and love dressing up.  Last year I was a ghost, but this year I am a lion.  My little brother is dressed like a dinosaur and he keeps chewing on everything.  He is only Three years old so I guess that is okay.  His name is @entity4 and his favorite holiday is his birthday but I do not think he knows much about any of them.  My dad loves @entity2 and my Mom really likes Thanksgiving.  But I love @entity1.   We have to wait for my dad to come home from work so we can go out and trick-or-treat.  While we are waiting my mommy cooks us dinner.  She wants us to eat good food before we spoil our dinner with all the candy we are going to get.  I ca not wait to go to my friend @entity3's house.  His parents give the best candy and give me extra since @entity3 is my friend.  I think @entity3 said he was going to dress up like a pirate but I do not remember.  I do not think pirates are very cool, but I did not tell @entity3 that.  I think I hear my dad coming up the stairs.  @entity0 is going to be the best @entity1 ever.
