@entity1 was very happy to get some money from her grandmother. She spent all morning at her grandmother's house doing chores for her. @entity0 was getting older, and sometimes she needed help with small things around the house.  The first thing that @entity1 did was clean the big window in her house. It was afternoon and the sun was shining, but it was hard to tell because the window was so dirty! @entity1 used water and soap to clean the window. It was very clean when she was finished.  Next, she swept the front porch. She put all of the dirt and leaves into a big bin in the front yard. That was a lot of work.  @entity1 was going back in the house for lunch when she saw that the light in the hall was out. She asked her grandmother to show her where the light bulbs were at so that she could change it. Since she was so short she had to get a stool to stand on. Her grandmother stood by to make sure she did not fall. This was her last job of the day.  After all of her hard work her grandmother made her a ham sandwich with no cheese. @entity1 did not like cheese. Then her grandmother gave her five dollars for helping. This was a whole dollar more than she got the last time!
