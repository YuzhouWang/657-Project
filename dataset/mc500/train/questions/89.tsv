There was once an octopus who lived under the ocean. His name was @entity4. @entity4 had never seen the world above the ocean before. He had spent all of his life under water with his friends, a blow fish named @entity1, a sponge named @entity3, a star fish named @entity2, and another octopus, @entity0. So you can imagine his surprise when he found a treasure chest that had been lost by a ship that had sunk. Inside the chest were things that were completely new to him. Among these was a whole bunch of food items, such as a bottle of ketchup, a coffee mug, a cherry pie, a sandwich, and more. When @entity4 found these things, he wanted to keep them all for himself. So when he returned to his friends, he did not tell them what he had found. When his best friend @entity0 asked him where he had been, @entity4 lied and said that he had only gone for a swim. But @entity0 did not believe him. Later on, when @entity4 was sound asleep in his bed, @entity0 visited his room to see what he had been up to. She went digging around in his room for something interesting. When she found the treasure chest, she was amazed at what was inside. But she was also upset at @entity4 for lying to her, so she woke up him in the middle of the night to yell at him. @entity4 understood his mistake and apologized to @entity0, and then they shared the food.
