One day there was a six year old little girl named @entity3 who lived in a big house with her family.  She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad.  Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies.  Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park.  Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in @entity1.  For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park.  Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides.  She cried more and more until one day she got brave.  She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast.  She got off the ride and loved it!  Her mom said to her, "Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!"  @entity3 was afraid again and cried and cried.  For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides.  The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home.  His girlfriend's name was @entity0 and she was older, and loved big rides.  @entity3 liked @entity0 a lot and wanted to make her like her.  When @entity0 asked @entity3 if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, @entity2.  She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year!  Now was the real test.  @entity0 asked @entity3 if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park.  She was afraid but wanted to show @entity0 how big she was.  At the beginning of the ride @entity3 was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill.  Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud.  She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud.  @entity3 was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.
