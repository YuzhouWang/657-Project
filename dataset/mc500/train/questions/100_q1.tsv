@entity2 went to the doctor yesterday. He was a little scared because he might have to get a shot, but his mother promised that it would not hurt. During the time they were in the waiting room, @entity2 played with some blue and green blocks and some toy cars that the doctor kept there for the children who came to see him. He also met another little boy named @entity0 who also had to see the doctor. @entity0 liked playing with the cars more than the blocks, but @entity2 liked playing with both of them. @entity2 also met a little girl named @entity1 who was playing with some dolls the doctor also had for the children. When it was @entity2's turn to see the doctor, his mother led him into one of the rooms and had him sit on a yellow chair. The doctor was a friendly man who wore glasses. He took @entity2's temperature and looked in his ears, then asked him a few questions about how he had been feeling. When @entity2 said his throat hurt a little, the doctor took a look at it as well. He said everything looked okay, and @entity2 would not need any shots this visit. On the way out Susan the nurse let @entity2 take a red lollipop from a basket on her desk. By the time @entity2 got home, he thought the doctor was not so scary after all.
