On Tuesday, @entity0 went to go visit his grandma for the day. She lived in a town close to where @entity0 lived, so @entity0 got in the car and his mom drove him to his grandma's house. @entity0 wanted to bring his big white dog with him, but his mom said no because his grandma does not like dogs. Instead, @entity0 brought his favorite toys: a blue car, a puzzle with a picture of green trees on it, and a few fun board games in brown boxes. When @entity0 got to his grandma's house, she was standing at the door waiting for him. She had a plate of cookies in her hands and was very excited to see him.  "Hi, @entity0!" She said.  "Hi, @entity1!" @entity0 said. "I'm so happy to see you!" @entity1 smiled. "We're going to have so much fun today, @entity0. I have ham sandwiches, chips, and fresh lemonade for lunch, and I also have a whole plate of warm cookies all for you." "Wow, @entity1, that sounds great! I brought some games for us to play. This is going to be a great day!"  @entity1 and @entity0 went inside @entity1's house and @entity0 opened his bag of toys to show @entity1. She looked at the car, the puzzle, and the games, and then looked at @entity0.  "Well, @entity0, what do you want to do first?" She asked.  @entity0 chose the puzzle, and they spent a few hours putting it together. Then, they ate lunch. The sandwiches, chips, lemonade and cookies are all delicious. @entity0 ate three whole cookies by himself. After lunch, they played outside with the car, and then when they got tired, they sat on the porch and rested. It was starting to get dark out.  "I had a great day, @entity0," @entity1 said.  @entity0 smiled. "Me too, @entity1. I love spending time with you!" @entity0 thought it had been a perfect day, even if he could not bring his dog.
