@entity1 is a normal human boy who enjoys football and playing with his toys. What makes him different is that he really enjoys talking to his magical reindeer @entity0. One day, @entity1 is walking around town with @entity0, and as they pass by the nearby farm, the farmer who owns the land calls out to them - "Hey! You, over there!" They quickly turn around, not sure if they are the ones being called to, but seeing no one nearby, they walk over to the farmer. "What do you need, sir?" @entity1 asks. "I need help with the plants; they're growing faster than normal. Can you help with the potato plants?" the farmer asks. "Sure! Let's help out, @entity0!" @entity1 happily answers. They end up spending the rest of the day helping, and are paid well, both in potatoes, carrots and money, for their work. "That was fun!" @entity1 says to @entity0, as they head home. @entity0 simple nods back, as they hurry back to their home.
