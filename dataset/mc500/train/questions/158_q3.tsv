As @entity1 put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow. He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. @entity1, wondered if his best friends @entity2, @entity0, and @entity3 were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.The next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with @entity3. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo @entity1 began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and @entity1 wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch.
