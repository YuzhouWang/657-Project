@entity2 ran upstairs as soon as she got home from school. Today she was a sad and angry girl. Her teacher had given her a lot of homework. @entity2 always thought homework was not fair. But she thought it was extra unfair today because she wanted to play with a new toy. The new toy was called @entity4 and @entity2's friends said it was very fun. When @entity2 ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed. @entity0, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly. While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it. Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better. Suddenly, @entity2 came up with a plan. She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth. As she chewed, she opened her toy chest. @entity2 had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys. Things were looking up! @entity2's plan was to build a robot to do her homework. @entity1 would get in the way of her plan. It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work. When it was done, she named the robot @entity3. She told it, "@entity3, do my homework!" Then @entity2 had to go eat dinner. After dinner, @entity2 spent the rest of the night playing @entity4. It was so much fun! But @entity2 got some bad news before going to bed. @entity3 had not done any of the homework!
