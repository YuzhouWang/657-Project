There was once a lion that lived in a circus. This lion, @entity1, was the biggest lion in the zoo, and he was often mean to the other lions in the circus. He was giant, and because of this, he scared the other lions, including the smallest one, @entity3. @entity3 was often bullied by @entity1, and the other lions, like @entity2 and @entity0, who copied him. @entity3 was hiding one day from @entity1, when the man who owned the circus took @entity1 out for training. @entity1 had to perform very difficult jobs for the circus, and when he did not get them right away, the circus man was very mean to @entity1. @entity1 came back to the lion pen and was very scared and hurt. All of the other lions, even @entity2 and @entity0, ignored @entity1, except for @entity3. @entity3 sat down next to @entity1 and scared away the lion cubs who might have bothered @entity1. @entity1 was very glad for what @entity3 did. When @entity1 kept learning the new stuff for the circus man, @entity3 kept him company when he got back. Soon, they grew to be good friends, and @entity1 found himself very sorry for all of the mean things he did to @entity3.
