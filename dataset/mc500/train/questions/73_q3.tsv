@entity0 was a very naughty boy.  He liked playing tricks on people.  Sometimes he would call Mrs. Walker at the hat store and roar at her on the phone.  Sometimes he would leave his wet blanket on the sidewalk so that it would squish under people's feet when they walked past.  Sometimes he would moo at his sister, June, to annoy her.  One time he even painted his friend @entity1's bedroom purple without asking. This upset @entity1 very much.  @entity1 did not want his bedroom to be purple.  @entity1 liked his bedroom blue and white, like his favorite sport's team.  Whenever @entity1 was sad his dog, @entity2, was also sad.  @entity0's naughty actions really hurt @entity1's feelings so he tried to hide from @entity0.  @entity0 found @entity1 anyway.   "Why are you hiding from me?" asked @entity0. "You were naughty.  You painted my bedroom without asking.  You even made @entity2 sad and now his tail will not wag." @entity0 felt very bad about hurting his friend's feelings.  He wanted to make his friend happy again.  The problem was he was out of paint.  @entity0 thought long and hard.  He had an idea!  He ran to his house and grabbed his favorite toy, his yellow dinosaur.  He handed it to @entity1.  "I'm sorry about your room.  I will not do anything like that again.  I ca not fix it right now, but you can have my dinosaur until I fix your room." @entity1 accepted @entity0's apology and both boys were happy.  @entity2 could wag his tail again.
