@entity1 and @entity2 were playing catch in the living room.  @entity0 told them that was dumb, but she did not stop them.  She kept writing in her notebook. If they wanted to get in trouble, then they could.  It was not her responsibility. @entity1 told @entity2 to go long.  @entity1 did not have good aim and missed @entity2's hands when he threw the ball.  Instead he hit the lamp and knocked it over.  He was glad he did not hit the dishes.  Nor did he hit the cat.  @entity2 was not glad that he hit the lamp, but was glad that the lamp was not broken. When @entity2's dad came home, he was very happy that @entity2 came clean about the lamp even when it was not broken.  After telling them off for playing inside, @entity2's dad made them all a cake.  The cake had lemon frosting, which was @entity1's favorite.  @entity0 cannot eat lemon, so she let @entity1 have her slice.  He chose to take @entity0's cake home to his Bro.  @entity1 thanked her a lot.
