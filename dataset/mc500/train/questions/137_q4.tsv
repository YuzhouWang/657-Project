There once was a beautiful princess named @entity2 who lived in a castle in the woods.  One day she went for a walk to see if any of the spring flowers had started to bloom.  Her mother's birthday was the next day.  If there were flowers blooming she would pick some for her mother. Her mother's name was @entity0.  As she got deeper into the woods she came to a place that had a lot of flowers.  There were beautiful lilies growing around the edge of a pond.  There were some deer drinking water from the pond.  She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.  The lilies were white and yellow and red.  She picked @entity4 lilies for her mother.  @entity2 also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.  There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.  She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods. She heard someone calling her name and was very happy to see her father standing near her. When she opened her eyes she also could see her brother @entity1 standing near her.  She could hear their dog, @entity3, rushing to meet them, too.
