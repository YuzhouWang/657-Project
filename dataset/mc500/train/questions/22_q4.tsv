Once upon a time, there was a cowgirl named @entity3. @entity0 was her favorite color. Her favorite food was the strawberry. She really liked her @entity2 phone, which allowed her to call her friends and family when out on the range. One day @entity3 thought she needed a new pair of boots, so she went to the mall. Before @entity3 went inside the mall, she smoked a cigarette. Then she got a new pair of boots. She could not choose between brown and red. Finally she chose red, which the seller really liked. Once she got home, she found that her red boots did not match her blue cowgirl clothes, so she knew she needed to return them. She traded them for a brown pair. While she was there, she also bought a pretzel from @entity1's.
