One day when driving home @entity0 saw a group of bicycle racers riding down the road. When they stopped at a store he pulled over to talk to them. Their names were @entity3, @entity1, and @entity2. When he asked them how they got into racing they each had a different story to tell. @entity2 started with his dad when he was much younger. @entity1 started when he met @entity2, who was racing. @entity3 started when he saw a race on TV. @entity0 was very interested in learning to race bicycles like the three men he met. So he asked them where he could buy a bike like theirs, and how much would it cost. @entity2 said he would give him his old bike for free. @entity1 told him of a store nearby, and @entity3 told him of a store on the web. @entity0 said goodbye to the racers so that they could keep going on their ride. @entity0 then went home and left @entity2 a note so that he could pick up his old bike. He then went to his desk to look up some stuff on bike racing. He was so excited his mother heard him from the other room shouting about wheels. He looked into the safety parts of bike riding including the wrong time to ride and the stuff he would need like, a helmet and horn.
