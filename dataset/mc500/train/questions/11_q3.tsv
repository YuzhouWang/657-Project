It was a hot Saturday afternoon, and @entity0 was going shopping with his mother. While she made her shopping list, @entity0 looked out the window. In the sky, he saw pretty birds. He smiled - @entity0 liked birds. He saw one last Friday when he was getting muddy in the puddles, and another on Wednesday when he was playing with his toy spaceship.Once his mother was done making her list, @entity0 got his shoes on before getting in the car. "Should I bring my jacket, @entity1?" he asked. "No," his mother answered, fixing his hair, "it is warmer today than it was yesterday, in fact, it's hot!"@entity0 and his mother got in the car, and drove off to the store. He leaned his head on the car window, looking at the animals and trees they passed. He saw flowers, a puppy, ants, and people walking, and even a chipmunk! When they got to the store, @entity0 and his mother grabbed an empty shopping cart. @entity0 always liked helping his mother do her shopping - she sometimes let him get a treat if he was good. They went up and down the aisles, picking up the things on the list, including @entity0' favorite food - peanut butter - and @entity0 was very well behaved.As they finished their shopping and walked to the front of the store in order to pay, @entity0' mother said, "@entity0, you can get a candy bar if you'd like, so I can say 'thank you' for being a super good helper today."@entity0 was so excited. He picked one with peanuts and chocolate, and placed it with the rest of their items. When they got home, @entity0 spent the rest of the day playing Legos in his room. It was a good day.
