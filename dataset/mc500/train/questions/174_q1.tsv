@entity0 was a monster. He was born in @entity1, where he learned how to be a monster and how to do monster things. One day @entity0 was very hungry. There are no stores in @entity1, so @entity0 had to find his own food. He saw some bugs but he did not want to eat those because bugs are gross and taste bad. Then he saw a bunny and thought it would be a good thing to eat. Bunnies are very delicious. Monsters eat all sorts of things that humans do not eat. @entity0 chased the bunny into a field. Soon he could not find it any more. @entity2 was sad. He was still hungry. But then he saw a house. He sneaked towards it and looked inside. No one was home. He crawled through an open window and saw a funny looking box. He opened it and saw many little pebbles inside of all different colors. He was about to eat them when a small human child appeared out of nowhere and took the box out of his hands. Silly @entity0, @entity4 are for kids.
