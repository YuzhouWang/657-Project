Once there was a granddaddy named @entity3 who had not seen his daughter @entity1 in many years. @entity1 had a daughter of her own named @entity2, but she and @entity3 had had a fight before @entity2 was born. Because of that, @entity3 had never met @entity2. @entity3's wife @entity0 had died many years before, so he lived alone. He liked living alone, but he missed @entity1. @entity3 spent most of his time working in his garden. He liked to plant pumpkins, peppers, and tomatoes. He hated peas and broccoli, so he never planted them. He liked zucchini and spinach, but he did not have any of those plants to plant. One day @entity3 got a call on his phone. He picked it up and asked who it was. The voice on the other end of the line said, "It's me, @entity1." @entity3 was so surprised he almost dropped the phone. He said, "@entity1, is it really you? I ca not believe it." @entity1 said that she had been thinking about @entity3 and she wanted to make up for their fight. @entity3 was so happy. They were going to meet the next weekend. Even before he hung up, @entity3 could imagine himself hugging his daughter. He sat down and thought about everything he wanted to say to her.
