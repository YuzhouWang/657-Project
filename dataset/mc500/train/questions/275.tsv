@entity1 was a boy who loved to eat spaghetti. One day he met a girl named @entity2. @entity0 said that @entity2 made the best spaghetti in the world. So @entity1 wanted to try some of @entity2's spaghetti. He asked @entity2, "@entity2, would you make me some spaghetti please?" @entity2 said, "Sure! Just come to my house tomorrow!" So the next day @entity1 went to @entity2's house, sat down in the dining room, and waited.Then @entity2 came out with a big plate of spaghetti with spinach soup. The only problem was that the spaghetti was bright blue. @entity1 said, "This spaghetti is blue! The soup is blue also! I hate the color blue and I wo not eat any blue food!" This made @entity2 sad, and she started to cry. This made @entity1 feel bad so he said, "It's okay, @entity2. Do not cry. I'll let you try again."So @entity2 made a new plate of spaghetti for @entity1. This time it was not blue and came with a salad with cheese. @entity1 said, "That's much better!" Then he started to eat. Suddenly @entity1 spit out all the spaghetti because there was a big nasty bug in it. This made @entity1 very angry and he threw all the spaghetti on the floor. @entity2 said, "I'm so sorry, I do not know how that got there!" @entity1 calmed down and said, "I'm sorry too. Let's forget the spaghetti. I can eat the salad instead." When @entity1 finished the salad, @entity2 asked if @entity1 wanted dessert. @entity1 said "no" because he was too full.
