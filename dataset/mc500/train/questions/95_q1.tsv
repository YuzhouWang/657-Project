@entity3 was hungry. He was very hungry because he had not eaten in Three days. @entity4 flew to @entity3's home and talked to him. @entity4 asked @entity3 why he had not eaten in so long. @entity3 said it was too cold outside. @entity4 said "But you have such nice, thick fur!" @entity3 said, "Well I am really too lazy." @entity4 said he would bring @entity3 any food he saw when he was flying around and left. @entity4 flew to other side of the forest to visit @entity0, but he did not see any food on the way. @entity0 was reading a book about cooking. "Hmm, there are so many delicious foods I have not tried yet." @entity4 arrived at @entity0's den and said "Hello @entity0, what are you doing?" @entity0 said "I am trying to think of what to have for dinner." "How can you choose?" asked @entity4. "Why do not we pick a color and eat something that is that color" said @entity0. "How about red?" said @entity4. "Yes! Like a fox!" said @entity0. "I know where a fox is!" said @entity4, "I'll show you." So @entity0 followed @entity4 all the way across the forest. Finally they arrived outside @entity3's home. "Pretend you are asleep and wait right here", said @entity4 to @entity0. @entity4 then flew in to @entity3's home very happy. "@entity3, I have found a big yummy treat for you and you wo not ever be hungry again! Follow me outside." @entity3 followed @entity4 outside and said "WOW! A whole tiger! @entity1!" Then @entity0 jumped up and gobbled up @entity3 in one bite. @entity3 was now inside @entity0's belly and he yelled out "@entity4, you lied to me! Why?!" "Because you ate my sister!" yelled @entity4. "That was not me, it was Snake!" cried @entity3. "Oh. @entity2, sorry @entity3. Well at least you do not have to hunt for food now" said @entity4. @entity0 laughed so hard that he coughed up @entity3. Then they all went and got ice cream.
