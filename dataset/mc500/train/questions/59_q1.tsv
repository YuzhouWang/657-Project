@entity0 had a pet. @entity0 loved his pet and would always laugh at the funny thing he did when facing his chin. The pet was a dog. @entity0 would blow in the dog's ear in order to make him mad. One day @entity0 wanted to give the dog a treat but he would not eat it. @entity0 got very upset and confused and said, "I think my dog is going to die." So @entity0 threw his dog a party in the sand to make his dog happy and have a great life. At the party they only listened to hit songs. @entity0 let his dog eat anything he wanted, even a dingdong. @entity0 invited the dog's favorite friend, his nana. He took his dog and the dog's nana and went for a drive on the road. At the end of the party @entity0 let his dog chew his favorite pencil. The dog was not dying, but he was happy he got to have the best party ever.
