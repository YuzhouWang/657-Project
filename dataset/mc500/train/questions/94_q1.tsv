@entity2 woke up. It was Tuesday, and he was at home. He was still sleepy, but his alarm clock was ringing and he knew he had to be on time for school. He wished it were Saturday or Sunday. He yawned, got out of bed, and put on his slippers. Then, he walked to the bathroom, where he brushed his teeth and washed his face. Still in his pajamas, he went down to the kitchen. His mother, @entity1, greeted him with a glass of orange juice and a big bowl of cereal. He was still kind of sleepy, but he drank his juice and ate his cereal. When @entity2 was done with his breakfast, he went upstairs and got his school clothes on. Then it was time to catch the bus to school. @entity2 hated the bus, because he was quiet and the bus was always loud. Plus there was always some kid who thought it was funny to make gross jokes or say bad words. Today, @entity2 was ready for the bus. With the sandwich and potato chips in his lunchbox, he had some cake he had made yesterday. He had used salt to make the cake instead of sugar. He knew it tasted horrible, and he was going to give a piece of cake to the first person who was bad on the bus, and he did not even care if he got in trouble. His friends @entity3, @entity0, and Charlotte were in on it, too. He sat in the house, a little excited, eating an apple and waiting until it was time to leave the house. It was time! He put on his shoes and left.
