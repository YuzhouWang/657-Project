@entity4, @entity0, @entity3 and @entity1 love to play @entity2. They did not really care for baseball, basketball or soccer much. They enjoy it so much that they like to draw silly pictures on to their arms and notebooks showing footballs. Then when the teacher sees them they have to use the pink erasers to erase the drawings. One day @entity4 was out playing football when he tripped and hurt his knee, the next day @entity0 was also playing football when he fell and hurt his arm. Both boys could not play their favorite games now. So to cheer them up, @entity0's parents bought them a new football game they could play at home. When @entity4 showed up to play, they had also made chocolate chip pancakes as a present to both of them, even if both of their favorite food was bacon, waffles and hamburgers. After some time both boys got bored with the game and thought to build their own. So they got some cardboard and tape and built a small table top football game. After that they were busy enough to forget their own hurt parts and had a lot of fun that day.
