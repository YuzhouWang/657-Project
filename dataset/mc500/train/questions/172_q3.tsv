@entity0 looked up at the clock hanging on the wall of his room. He could not wait for his friend @entity1 to come over today. It was the weekend, so @entity0's dad had no work the next day. This meant his father would take them sledding. This was one of @entity0' favorite winter activities, even if he always got a few bumps and scrapes along the way.@entity0 heard a knocking noise downstairs and knew it was @entity1 at the door. He got excited. This meant they would be sledding soon. He grabbed another mouthful of one of his mother's famous sugar cookies and made his way downstairs, tripping on his shoes. He opened the door to see @entity1's mom giving him a friendly smile down the walk. @entity1 let himself in and his mother waved goodbye to them both. @entity0 asked @entity1 if he wanted a cup of hot chocolate and then he went to find his dad for some sledding action. Both @entity1 and @entity0 were very happy. They got their gloves on and made their way out to the garage to wait for @entity0' dad. @entity0 dad would be driving them the long distance to the park.
