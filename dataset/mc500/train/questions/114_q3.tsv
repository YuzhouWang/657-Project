One day, @entity4 bought a pet hamster name @entity1. @entity1 was round and furry and had a funny smell. @entity4 loved it when @entity1 would climb up his arm and into his shirt sleeve. Every day before bed @entity4 would put @entity1 into his cage and every morning @entity4 would take @entity1 out of his cage and carry him around in his front shirt pocket during the day. @entity4 would carry @entity1 everywhere he went. @entity4's favorite thing to do was to watch @entity1 run around in his exercise wheel.  Then one day @entity4 woke and to find that @entity1 was not in his cage. @entity1 had gone missing! This made @entity4 very upset. He looked everywhere for @entity1, wondering where he could have disappeared to. @entity4 called his friends @entity2, @entity0, and @entity3 to ask if they knew where @entity1 was. They said that they did not know. So @entity1 asked them if they would help him look for @entity1. Only @entity2 and @entity3 said "yes". to help @entity4. After looking for @entity1 for two hours @entity3 found @entity1 inside an old sock behind @entity4's desk. No one knew how he got there.
