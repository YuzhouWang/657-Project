A tiger named @entity2 and @entity3 named @entity4 were going for a walk in the park by the river and were going to go swim later. As @entity2 was running through a field in the park he came upon a small hamster with a broken leg. The hamster looked like it had somewhere to go but could not make it because of its leg. @entity2 called @entity4 over to come talk to the hamster and see if there was anything they could do to help. As they talked, @entity2 and @entity4 started to become good friends with the hamster. They found out his name was @entity1. @entity1 was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it. Luckily for @entity0 mom was a nurse and after watching her work for many years @entity4 knew how to set a broken bone and fix it. After @entity4 fixed @entity1's leg he picked him up and put him on @entity2's back and they all went to the river to get some water. They all were best friends for the rest of their lives and played together.
