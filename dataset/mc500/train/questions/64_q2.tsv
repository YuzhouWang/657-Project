@entity6 the lion lived in @entity1.  He was a happy lion, and he liked to lay in the sun all day.  One day when @entity6 got hungry, he thought about strawberries.  He had never had a strawberry before.  "Oh," he thought, "strawberries must be very tasty."  He thought about how red they were, and how sweet they must taste.  "I have to have a strawberry," said @entity6. So @entity6 went to talk to his friends, to find out if they had any strawberries.  He walked to a big field where he saw his friend @entity3 the @entity4.  @entity6 asked @entity3 if he had any strawberries.  "No, I do not," said @entity3, "All I have is a banana."  @entity6 was sad, because he really wanted a strawberry, but he would not stop there. @entity6 walked to the river to find his friend @entity0, the duck.  It was a long way to walk, but @entity6 really wanted a strawberry.  When he finally got there, he asked, "Do you have any strawberries?"  "No," said @entity0, "I only have is an apple."  This made @entity6 really sad, but he would not stop there. @entity6 knew that he only knew one other friend who might have a strawberry, and that was @entity2 the @entity5.  So he walked and walked and walked until he was finally at his friend @entity2's house.  @entity6 was tired, but would not give up.  @entity6 asked, "Do you have any strawberries?"  @entity2 said, "Yes!  Help yourself."  @entity6 was excited, and finally tasted his first strawberry.  @entity6 thought it was tasty.
