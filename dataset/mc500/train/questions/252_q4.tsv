@entity7 was an old man who lived in @entity0.  @entity7 used to work at the @entity5 before he quit.  @entity7 has a grandson named @entity3.  @entity3 came to visit @entity7 and brought his friends @entity4, @entity6, and @entity2.  @entity7 gave them each a glass of lemonade to drink.  @entity3 wanted his friends to try his grandfather's meat soup.  @entity7 was known to be a good cook.  He enjoyed cooking burgers, fish, pizza, and soup.  @entity7's meat soup was his favorite recipe.  @entity7 asked his grandson to go to the store to buy the food.  He wanted @entity3 to buy some meat.  @entity3 took some money from @entity7 and went to @entity1.   @entity3 thought of buying ground beef, chicken, turkey, and sausage.  He bought three pounds of ground beef.  He took it back to @entity7, who had started making the soup in his kitchen.   @entity7 cooked the ground beef and added it to the soup.  They let the soup cook for two hours and then @entity7 tested it to see if it was ready to eat.  The soup tasted delicious.  @entity3 and his friends loved it and told @entity7 they would be back for more.
