One Thursday morning, @entity1's dad was making him breakfast. @entity1 came downstairs in his favorite blue shirt and fed his dog @entity2. After washing his hands, @entity1 sat down to a hot plate of pancakes, eggs, and bacon. @entity1's baby sister Emily began to cry in her high chair. @entity1 gave Emily her pink pacifier to calm her down. After breakfast, @entity1 took @entity2 out to the backyard to play fetch in the green grass. @entity1 only threw the ball a few times before it started to rain and they had to come back inside. @entity2 shook himself to get the water off him and splashed @entity1. @entity1's dad asked @entity1, "Do you want to play a game?" @entity1 said that he did and ran to get his favorite board game, @entity0. When they sat on the living room floor to play, Emily crawled over to sit in @entity1's lap. @entity2 lay next to @entity1's dad with his head on his paws. @entity1 thought this rainy day was perfect.
