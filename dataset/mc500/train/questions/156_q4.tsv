@entity0 is a very happy cow. He's dark brown, with big blue eyes, and a soft pink nose.  He lives in a huge field during the summer, with beautiful, and tasty, buttercups and hay.  During the winter he lives in a nice, warm barn.  The hay is not as tasty then, but it keeps him fed until summer comes back.  One winter day @entity0 wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright. He had never gone out during the winter because the @entity3 always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and @entity0 could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground. He had to know why! So @entity0 pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door. @entity0 was surprised and confused by the ground outside, it was so white and sparkly. His breath started fogging in the air, and the ground was cold and crunchy. "What is this?" He asked the rooster sitting on the fence. The roosters name was @entity2, and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head.   "It's snow, son! Did you grow up in a barn?!" The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house.  "It's so pretty!" @entity0 said. He pushed it with his nose. "Oh! It's so chilly!" He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits. He wanted to see if they had a good taste, when he heard the farmer.  "@entity0! What are you doing out here?" The farmer, named @entity1, asked. He was loud, but not mad. "It's much too cold for a small cow like you, we better get you back inside!" He pushed @entity0 inside the barn, and this time locked the barn door tight.
