@entity0 was looking up at the sky when he saw it.  He saw a bright light.  It got brighter and brighter.  But after a few seconds, it started getting less bright.  It took him a second to know for sure, but he knew he had seen a shooting star!This was not the first time that @entity0 had seen something strange in the sky.  It was last year, when he was driving home from work at night.  He saw another light in the sky that night, but it was not anything like this one.  The one he saw last year did not get brighter.  The one he saw last year did not get less bright.  The one he saw last year was round, and @entity0 was sure that it was a space ship.When @entity0 saw the shooting star tonight, he was even more sure of what he saw last year.  Some people said that the space ship was really a shooting star.  But now that he had seen a real shooting star, he knew for sure that this one was different.@entity0 wondered what planet the space ship had come from.
