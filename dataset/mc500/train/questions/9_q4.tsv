@entity1 woke up very early that morning in his bedroom in his house. He felt something licking his face and he was not sure what it was. As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur. Then he saw a tongue. After that, some more fur and then slurp! He was licked again!"Oh, @entity0!" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been @entity2's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and @entity2 woke up many times this way.One of the most memorable adventures that @entity2 and @entity0 had happened when @entity2 was @entity3. @entity2 wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with @entity0. @entity2 had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. @entity0 was walking and @entity2 was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near @entity2's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. @entity0 was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! @entity2 was not sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. All of the sudden, @entity0 fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. @entity2 yelled, "@entity0!" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after @entity0. @entity0's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, @entity2 caught up to him, but he could not get back to the side of the river!As @entity2 was thinking this was the last of him and @entity0, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and @entity2 grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and @entity0 out of the river. "Boy, was that close!" @entity2 yelled out loud!That was the best adventure ever!
