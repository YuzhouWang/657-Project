@entity1 the bee wanted to go visit his friend @entity2 the fly. @entity2 lived very far away, it would a long trip for @entity1. @entity1 first flew over a jungle, in the jungle he met a nice tiger by the name of @entity3. @entity3 wanted to play but @entity1 had no time, he still had a long way to go. Then @entity1 flew by a lake. At the lake he met a cowboy. The cowboy was named @entity0. @entity0 was letting his horse get a drink of water from the lake. The horse drank a lot and when he was done he let out a huge burp. @entity1 waved goodbye to @entity0 and his horse. @entity1 then stopped for lunch, he had some bread he brought with him from home. While he was sitting when all of the sudden a pig walked up to him. He did not get the pigs name, because the pig could only say oink. Finally, after a long trip, @entity1 finally got to the house of @entity2 the fly. @entity2 wanted to play, but @entity1 was too tired. So @entity1 went to sleep.
