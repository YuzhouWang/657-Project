Her mother had packed the best lunch she could for @entity1. @entity1 was thankful, but it was only a turkey sandwich with lettuce on it. Her mother meant well, but @entity1 could only eat this turkey so many times before she got sick of it. @entity1 thought she wanted something tastier to eat. She took her bike around the block and locked it to the birdbath in front of the grocery. That is when @entity1 found the most delicious looking tomatoes stocked on grocery's shelves. She took one down from the top shelf that looked very good and made her way to the front of the store. @entity0, the man at the front of the store, gave her a warm smile and told her how much her tomato would cost. She used the money her mother had given her for a book to pay. She hid her prize in her bag and then made her way back to her apartment.  @entity1's mother was in the back room she could safely cut up the tomato and place it on her sandwich without her mother knowing because she knew her mother would be upset. @entity1's mother had given allowance to buy a book for school, not a tomato. The young girl smiled to herself as she took a bite into her sandwich.
