@entity0 and @entity2 were having a party for their good friend @entity1. @entity1 had graduated high school and they wanted to show her how proud they were of her, and @entity1 would be moving far away at the end of the year. @entity1 was going to college to become a doctor. She thought about becoming a lawyer or an engineer. She even thought about being a scientist. @entity1 would be bringing her friend Mike.  There would not be many people at the party, since this was a celebration with close friends. @entity0 set out drinks and snacks for @entity1 and the other guests. The snacks she set out were salty pretzels.
