There once was a little girl named @entity0 who lived in a wooded forest. One evening she was getting a ride home from school in her grandpa's truck she saw smoke rising from a fire far in the distance. @entity0 was worried about the fire and the danger facing all the animals that live in the forest. She immediately rushed home and waited for her mother, a doctor to come home. While she was waiting for her mother to come home she ate some popcorn and talked to her grandpa about the smoke. @entity0's grandpa, @entity1 told her that fires are almost always put out by hard working fireman. @entity0 feels better knowing that brave firefighters are out there bravely trying to save the forest and the animals that live there. She grabs her favorite stuffed animal, a monkey and says a prayer for her treasured forest and then falls asleep on the couch. She wake up to the friendly face of her smiling mother who tells her that the fire is safely put out.
