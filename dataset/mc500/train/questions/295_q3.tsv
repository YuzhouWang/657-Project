@entity1 the dinosaur was going to go to a dinosaur birthday party that night, and he was very excited, because the party was for him! He was turning Seven years old, which in dinosaur years, that means he was going to be an adult! There were so many different things he was going to do! He knew that there was going to be a moon bounce, and that he was going to get a lot of presents from all of his dinosaur friends, but the thing that he was most excited about, was the cake! @entity1's favorite food was cake, and he hoped that they got the right flavor. @entity1's favorite flavor was banana. @entity1 went to school that day and everyone told him happy birthday! When he came home from school, all the lights were out. "Hello?" @entity1 said, as he came into the house. All of the sudden, the lights went on, and there was everyone! "Happy birthday @entity1!" all of his friends shouted. @entity0 went everywhere. "Where is the cake?" he asked. "Here it is!" said his mom, and brought out the cake. "It's a chocolate cake, like you wanted!" @entity1 froze. "I said that I wanted a banana cake." said @entity1. He was very sad. "Now the party is going to be no fun." "Oh @entity1." said his mom. "Your friends are here, and we worked very hard to set up this party for you! Please at least go spend some time with your friends." @entity1 was sad, but he tried to have fun. And the more he tried to have fun, the more he liked the party. The moon bounce was fun, and the gifts were very nice. He found out that you can still have fun even when things do not go as planned.
