@entity1 woke up bright and early on Friday morning during summer.  Her birthday was only a day away, and her parents had promised her a trip to the fair as her present the next day!  She thought it was going to be quite a treat.  She skipped down the stairs to see her mom making a chocolate cake on the stove.  "You run along outside to go play with your friends," her mom told her, "I can get everything ready for your special lunch on my own."   When @entity1 made it outside, she found her friend @entity0 playing in the dirt.  When @entity1 came closer, she saw that in the dirt were a bunch of insects.  @entity0 loved finding and collecting different ones for her insect collection.  @entity1 thought it was kind of gross personally, but she sat down next her anyways. "Happy birthday, @entity1," @entity0 yelled when she saw her best friend. "Thank you," @entity1 answered, "Do you want to go up to the playground until it's time for lunchtime?  @entity2 says you're invited to come by the way." @entity0 nodded, and the two spent a fun morning playing on the playground.  Once lunchtime came, the two walked back to @entity1's house.  She could picture how many of her favorite foods her mom had most likely made, and she could almost taste the spaghetti on her tongue.  @entity3 was ready when they arrived, and it was delicious!  The chocolate cake her mom made was an extra special treat.  She could not wait to go to the fair tomorrow!
