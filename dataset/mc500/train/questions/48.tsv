@entity0 got a letter from his granddaddy that said there was something cool to see. He called his granddaddy on the telephone and asked what it was. He was told that he needs to come over to see it for himself. After asking his parents if it was OK, @entity0 went to his granddaddy's house. When he got there, they turned off the television and lamp and went around to the backyard. In his granddaddy's backyard, there was a river and lots of plants and flowers. They followed the river and found a pond. The pond was full of goldfish because it was a goldfish pond. There were goldfish of every different color in the pond and it was an amazing sight. @entity0 had lunch with his granddaddy by the pond and thanked him for showing the interesting pond to him. After that, @entity0 went home and told his parents about how cool the trip was.
