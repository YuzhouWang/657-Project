Ms. @entity0 loved to make vanilla cupcakes! @entity1 loved her cupcakes, and she loved making them, too. One morning, she was in the store, buying ingredients for her  cupcakes, when she came across the most delicious looking chocolate frosting she had ever seen in her life! She bought a whole bunch, excited about how delicious her cupcakes would be for her cupcake party tonight!She went home and took extra care making her cupcakes that afternoon. She made them extra fluffy, sweet and delicious. She even pulled out her favorite sprinkles for her cupcakes, bright purple ones, which was her favorite color. She could not believe how amazing her cupcakes were going to be for the cupcake party!That night at the cupcake party, Ms. @entity0 showed everyone her plate of delicious cupcakes! So many of her friends were there for the party. There was Mrs. Apple, @entity3, Ms. Mitten, @entity4 and even quiet Mr. @entity2 showed up. @entity1 was very happy about her cupcakes! @entity1 except Mr. @entity2. Mr. @entity2 took one bite of that cupcake and said, "Eew! This is the worst cupcake in the world!"Ms. @entity0 did not know what to say! Were they really the worst cupcakes in the world? She had tried so hard! Ms. @entity0 started to cry. "Why do not you like my cupcakes, Mr. @entity2? I worked so hard to make the extra delicious!"Mr. @entity2 said, "I do not like vanilla, and I do not like chocolate!" Ms. @entity0 cried even more!"There, there," said Mrs. Apple, and patted Ms. @entity0 on the head.  "It's okay. Not everyone is going to like your cupcakes! You only have to know that you worked hard and that they're still tasty!" With that, Ms. @entity0 stopped crying, and she and Mr. @entity2 made up.
