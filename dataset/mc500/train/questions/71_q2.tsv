@entity0 was a little dog that loved to ride the train. Every day when the sun came up @entity0 would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on. He thought this was the best time of his life. He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric. Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar. Sometimes when @entity0 would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur. His friend, @entity1, did not like it when @entity0 came home dirty. If @entity0 came home with mud on his fur, @entity1 would make him sleep outside for the night, but if @entity0 came home clean he would sleep in the house. @entity0 did not mind sleeping outside, because he could hear the train's whistle and he would dream all night about the train. The funny thing about @entity0 was that he did not like going for a drive with @entity1 in a car, on a bike or in a boat. The only way you get @entity0 to go somewhere was on a train. @entity0 must have been a train driver in a past life.
