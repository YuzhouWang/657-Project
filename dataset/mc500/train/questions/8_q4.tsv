Once upon a time, a horse, a cow, a ox, and a donkey were playing outside when they got really hungry. So, they went to a drive-in to get some lunch. The horse ordered a cheeseburger. The cow ordered a chili dog. The ox ordered a chicken sandwich. And the donkey ordered a fish sandwich. The horse ordered fries. The cow ordered onion rings. The ox ordered a baked potato. The donkey ordered a side salad. The horse had ketchup on his cheeseburger. The cow had mayonnaise on his chili dog. The ox had mustard on his chicken sandwich. And the donkey had @entity0 on his fish sandwich. But the restaurant did not get any of the orders right because they had their sauces mixed up. The ketchup got mixed up with the @entity0. The mayonnaise got mixed up with the ketchup. The mustard got mixed up with the mayonnaise. And the @entity0 got mixed up with the mustard. The @entity0 was red. The ketchup was yellow. The mayonnaise was blue. And the mustard was green.
