@entity0 wanted to make a fun meal one day. After thinking about it for a long time, he chose to make a chicken dish. @entity0 made a trip to the store to collect all of the different things he would need to make this meal. He drove his blue truck to the store. On the way he passed a green car, a red van, and a yellow bus. When he got to the store, he met his friends Bob & @entity2. He asked if they had seen his friend @entity1, but they said no. At the store, @entity0 bought two pieces of chicken, tomato sauce, cheese, and bread. He drove back to the house, but he saw that something was missing. He had forgotten to grab the bag with the bread in it. He drove back to the store, apologized to the clerk, and grabbed his bag with the bread inside. When he got home, he began to get the food ready. It took him an hour to get the chicken ready to cook and the oven heated up. After that, it took him another hour to cook the food. He had to wait another hour after it was done cooking for his dinner guests to arrive. When they finally arrived, everyone told @entity0 how wonderful the food tasted, and everyone at the table asked for seconds. @entity0 smiled, glad that everyone loved this meal that he had worked so hard to make.
