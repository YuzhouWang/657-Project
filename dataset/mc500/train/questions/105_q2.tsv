@entity4 Claus makes sure that every year at @entity2 time that his reindeer are ready to deliver gifts to girls and boys all over the world. Without the reindeer, how would @entity4 fly from home to home? The most important thing that @entity4 has to do for the reindeer is to make sure they have their coffee on @entity2 Eve. Without the coffee, they wo not stay awake for very long. Sleeping reindeer are not very helpful. @entity4 also gives the reindeer candy to keep up their energy. In the @entity1, the main candy is candy canes in red and white. @entity0 love the candy canes that are different colors best and @entity4 says that helps them fly faster. Next, @entity4 has to make sure that the reindeer have a good meal before they go. @entity4 wants to make sure he does not have to share the cookies kids leave for him. The last thing @entity4 has to do is make sure the reindeer know where they are going. @entity4 has only been lost one time on @entity2 Eve and he does not want that to happen again.
