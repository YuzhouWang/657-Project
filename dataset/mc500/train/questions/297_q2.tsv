@entity0 looked up high. She could see the scissors up on top of the cabinet. If she could only reach them, she could cut the gum out of her baby sister's hair and her mom would never know. Her mom was still busy helping her brother take out the trash. @entity0 quickly pushed a chair over to the cabinet. She climbed up on the chair and got the scissors. Then she hopped down and put the chair back at the table. @entity0 ran to the bathroom and shut the door. While her sister sat on the floor, @entity0 cut the gum and a big piece of @entity1's hair, and then threw it into the trash. @entity0 put on her dress, then she and @entity1 headed back to the kitchen for breakfast. @entity0 had taken a drink of her chocolate milk when she heard her brother Kyle start to laugh and point at @entity1's head. Their mother heard the laugh and turned around to see what was so funny. @entity0 began to turn red before their mother even asked what had happened. "I did it," @entity0 said in a quiet voice, "I'm sorry, @entity2."
