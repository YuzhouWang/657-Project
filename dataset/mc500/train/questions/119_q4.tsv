@entity1 likes the man. @entity1 is a gray, winter glove the man found in the snow. The man likes to bring lost gloves home. He puts them in a box. The gloves are warm and safe in the box. They also get to meet new friends when the man finds them and puts them in the box. @entity1 has made many new friends since the man found him. He has become good friends with @entity2, @entity4, and @entity0. Two of them, @entity2 and @entity4, were found in the snow, like @entity1. @entity0 was not. She was found in a pile of leaves. @entity2 is a bright orange glove, @entity0 is a pink mitten, and @entity4 is a pink glove with purple fingers. @entity0 also has a friend named @entity3. He is a large, black glove who the man found in a building. @entity1 has met him, but they are not good friends yet. They all like to play tag and talk about how much they like their new lives. @entity1 is really happy the man found him and he made so many new friends.
