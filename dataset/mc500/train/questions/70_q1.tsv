@entity1 loved the beach and went as often as she could. She liked the birds and the waves.  @entity0 did not like the beach. He did not like how warm the sand was. He did not like the salt in the water. @entity0 wanted to stay home. @entity0 went to the beach with his mother and father and met @entity1. She had a red kite that @entity0 liked very much. @entity1 was having trouble getting the kite in the air and was sad. @entity0 went over to help her and together they got the kite into the air and watched it go higher and higher. @entity1 let @entity0 fly the kite for a little bit. After that @entity0 was hungry. @entity1 showed him that she had brought a green Picnic basket from her house. Inside the picnic basket there were cakes and sandwiches and salad and some fruit. @entity0 had brought lemonade in a blue bottle and shared it with @entity1. It was the most fun @entity0 had at the beach.
