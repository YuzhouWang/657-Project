@entity2 and @entity0 were friends. @entity2 was an inchworm. He had a skinny body and was bright green. @entity0 was a ladybug. She had a round body and was red with black spots. They liked to play together in the grass.  One day @entity2 and @entity0 were playing in the grass. @entity0 saw something new. She asked @entity2, "What is that yellow thing?" @entity2 did not know. They went over to the yellow thing. It was not grass. It was not alive. It was big and flat and looked like it might be fun for jumping. @entity0 said, "Let's jump on it." @entity2 said, "Okay, but I hope we do not get in trouble." They jumped on the big yellow thing. It was fun! They were happy jumping together! All of a sudden, the big yellow thing moved. It went up in the air. @entity2 and @entity0 held on. It went up and up. It went into the sky. @entity2 and @entity0 were scared. They wanted to get down. They shouted, "Help, help!" A bird heard them and flew over. His name was @entity1. @entity1 said, "What's wrong? Do not you like it up here on your kite?" "No, we do not!" said @entity2. "What's a kite?" said @entity0. @entity1 told them they were on a kite. He showed them the string. He said, "You can follow that string all the way to the ground." It looked like a long way down. But they thanked @entity1 for his help and slowly crawled down the string to the ground. They were safe.
