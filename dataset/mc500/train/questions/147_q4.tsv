Once upon a time there was a blue spider named @entity0. All spiders have to get rid of their old skin in order to grow a new, larger skin. @entity0 was a very special kind of spider because his tenth new skin would be pink instead of blue. When it was time for @entity0 to turn pink, he was very excited, but he was also worried. He was afraid that his best friend, an orange cat named @entity2, would not know that the pink spider was @entity0 in his new skin. He was scared that @entity2 would mistake him for a normal spider who does not change colors. If @entity2 saw a spider who was not @entity0, he would likely kill the spider and eat it. @entity0 was hoping to tell @entity2 that he would soon turn pink, but @entity2 did not come around to visit that day. @entity0 called over @entity1, the neighbor's dog.  @entity0 asked @entity1 to please tell @entity2 that he would be pink after he grew his new skin but would still be the same @entity0 he had always been.  @entity1 normally liked to chase @entity2 around the neighborhood. He knew he would have to be nice to @entity2 to deliver the message and that it would be really hard. Because it was so important to @entity0, @entity1 said he would deliver the message. @entity1 had a special respect for spiders because they eat other bugs. @entity1 is afraid of other bugs because they could bite him and make him sick. That evening, @entity0 began growing his new, pink skin, and @entity1 explained to @entity2 that he should not eat the pink spider because it was still his old friend.
