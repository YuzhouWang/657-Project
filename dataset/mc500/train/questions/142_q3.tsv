@entity1 and his mom, @entity2, ran across the front lawn of their house. The grass was very tall, the lawn had not been mowed. After removing the groceries from the car, @entity1 had wanted to play in the yard. @entity2 did not. She was sad that her new boss at work, @entity3, did not seem to like her. She ran along with @entity1, but he could tell that @entity2 was upset. @entity1 asked his mom what was bothering her. @entity2 explained that she felt like her new boss was not nice to her. @entity1 sat down in the grass and asked @entity2 to sit down next to him. He told her that he had a bully in his class named @entity0. @entity1 said that all he had to do was ignore the bully and he would feel better. Then @entity1 asked why his mom could not ignore her new boss. @entity2 explained to @entity1 that her new boss could fire her. @entity2 frowned, took off her pink shoes, and walked inside the house to make rice for dinner.
