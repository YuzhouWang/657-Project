@entity2 always loved the ocean. Whenever her parents would talk about going to the beach, she would get so excited that she could not sleep the night before. @entity0 was one of those nights. As she lay in bed, @entity2 could not help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day. She would build sand castles, splash in the water, and play Frisbee with her older brother, @entity1. All of theses thoughts and more raced through her head, until finally she fell asleep. In the early hours of the morning, @entity2 awoke to her brother making loud noises in her ear. He was so annoying. A little bit later, her mother and father came in the room, helping @entity2 and @entity1 get ready for the day. When everyone was dressed and all of their belongings were packed, the whole family set off for a day of fun in the sun. The ride was long and their van was hot and stuffy, even with the windows rolled down. After what seemed like hours, @entity2 spotted the road sign signaling that the beach was close! @entity2's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside. @entity2 and @entity1 both cheered. They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door. There were so many different flavors! @entity1 always got chocolate, because that was @entity4's favorite flavor, too. @entity3 chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather. @entity2 could not choose. She really wanted mint chocolate chip, but they were all out. Finally she chose the shop's special flavor "Tropical Turtle". The family left with smiles on their faces, ready to have a great day at the beach.
