A little boy named @entity0 and his best friend @entity1 are walking home from school one day in the cold. They walk and talk about how different kindergarten is from the first grade. @entity0 and @entity1 are in different classes and they do different things. @entity0's teacher has the kids do lots of arts and crafts making sock puppets, pasting pictures and many other things. @entity1 wishes he was in the same class as @entity0 because they are best friends and he likes doing arts and crafts. @entity0 tells @entity1 that they are going to be best friends even if they are in different classes, this makes @entity1 feel better. @entity0 remembers that @entity1's birthday party is next week and he gets excited. @entity0 has the idea to make @entity1 a birthday cake with the help of his mother. They finally arrive at the corner where @entity0 lives and they promise to meet up the next morning for the walk to school. @entity1 lives three houses down and he races home.
