There was once a leprechaun named @entity0 who spent his days at the end of a rainbow guarding his golden bowl of cereal. @entity0 was one of the toughest leprechauns in all the land, so no one dared to mess with him or try to take his bowl. That is, until an angel named @entity1 fell from @entity2. @entity1 had broken her wing, so she had no choice but stay on @entity4, and could not return to the sky. So she chose to make the best of it and went to see all of the beautiful and interesting things on @entity4. One day, she came across @entity0's rainbow, and was amazed by it. She followed the rainbow to the end, wondering what could be there. Then she saw it: @entity0's golden bowl. From the time she saw the bowl, she knew she wanted it.  She had heard about how tasty cereal was when she lived in @entity2, but she never tried it for herself. When she went to have some of the cereal, @entity0 the @entity3 popped out from behind the rainbow and laughed at her. "Do not you know," he said, "that I'm the toughest leprechaun in all the land? What makes you think you can eat a box of cereal from my golden bowl?" The angel saw that he was right, and she could not argue with him. So she left to find something to trade. She came across a seesaw which looked very interesting. She thought that @entity0 might like it, so she brought the seesaw to his rainbow and said, "I've come bearing a seesaw." When @entity0 saw the seesaw, he loved it. He did not argue or laugh at @entity1, and traded for his bowl right there. @entity1 ate from it, and it was delicious.
