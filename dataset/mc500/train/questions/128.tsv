Once upon a time there was a boy monster named @entity2 who lived in a train car at the railroad tracks. He had lived there all his life. @entity2's mother was named @entity4, and she was @entity0. @entity4 raised @entity2 at the railroad tracks because she wanted to keep him safe. She was afraid of the people who lived in the town nearby. The town was named @entity1, and One hundredZero people lived there. @entity4 believed that the people of @entity1 would attack them if they knew they were there. @entity1 used to be filled with factories when @entity2 was born. By the time @entity2 was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town. Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn. They did not eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals. One day when he was @entity3, @entity2 asked his mother who his father had been. His father's name was @entity5, and he was Two years older than @entity4. @entity4 looked sad and told @entity2 that @entity5 had left after he was born because the people in the town did not like him. This made @entity2 very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and did not talk to @entity4 again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left. When @entity4 woke up she was upset, but she thought she knew where he had gone.
