@entity5 walked to the store to buy some milk, like he does every Tuesday. On his way, he passed the red house where @entity4 lives, the green house where June lives, the white house where @entity2 lives, the blue hat store, and the orange house where @entity0 lives. He finally reached the store at @entity3 o'clock.  @entity5 thought about buying some other things too. He looked at the potato chips, but did not like the flavors they had left. All of the normal flavored ones were gone. He never liked hard candy, so he ignored those. He saw the apples, but did not need one because he had apples at home. So he picked out some cookies instead. @entity5 thought he'd eat them on his way home. He waited in line until it was his turn, and then paid @entity1 the cashier. @entity1 gave him his change and wished him a good day. On his way home, @entity5 ate his cookies. He had hoped to buy peanut butter cookies, but the store never has those. Instead, he bought sugar cookies. He liked them very much too, so he was not at all upset. When he got home, he poured a glass of milk and finished his cookies.
