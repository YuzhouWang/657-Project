One sunny May afternoon, a group of teenagers ditched school and went to the mall. June volunteered to drive her friends @entity2, @entity3, and @entity0. The teenagers piled into the red car and drove to the mall. When they arrived, @entity2 and @entity3 wanted to go to the sporting goods store. However, @entity0 and June wanted to go watch a movie directed by @entity1. They split up and said they would meet up at the food area later. Three hours later, the friends got back together. @entity2 and @entity3 wanted to leave, so they went back out to the parking lot and got in the car. When June backed out of the parking spot, she scraped the car next to her. @entity3 said it was okay, but @entity0 said June needed to leave a note for the driver of the other car. Just then, the other driver appeared. They called the police to get an accident report. When the police arrived, they put @entity2 and @entity3 in handcuffs because they had been stealing. They had to volunteer every week until October.
