One morning, @entity1 was putting on her shoes when she heard a knock at the door. When she opened it, she saw her friend @entity0 standing on the porch. "@entity2 is going to build a fort in my backyard today, and I get to help," @entity0 said. "Would you like to come over and help too?" @entity1 thought about what she had to do that day. Her mother had told her she needed to get her chores done before she could play at @entity0's house. "First, I have to clean my room," @entity1 told @entity0.  "Maybe I can help you," @entity0 said. "I helped Sam clean his room once." "Sure!" @entity1 answered. The girls went to @entity1's room and started to pick up toys and clothes. "Maybe I need to clean under the bed," @entity1 said. Under the bed, she found a library book she had been missing. @entity0 finished putting all of the clothes into the hamper. "Thanks for the help!" @entity1 said. "Now I can go with you." "I hope we do not have to clean my room, too!" said @entity0.
