@entity0 was really smart.  She knew how to spell really well.  She won every spelling prize from her teacher.  Her teacher told her that soon the whole school would have a spelling test.  @entity0 wanted to get the highest grade.  Her two best friends were going take it too.  She dreamed that they would all get prizes.  Every day she practiced spelling new words.  Her family always laughed.  "Is that a spelling word @entity0?" they would ask.  Then they would all practice it together.  @entity0 walked with her dog to school each day excited.  Soon the day of the test arrived.  @entity0 was not nervous.  She had eaten a big breakfast.  She had worn her lucky socks.  She had spelled every single word she knew out loud.  When @entity0 got her test, she picked up her sharpened pencil and happily started writing her name.  The spelling test was going to be hard, but she could do it!
