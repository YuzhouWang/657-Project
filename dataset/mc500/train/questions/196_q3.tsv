On Tuesday evening, @entity3 wanted to play with his friends at a playground near his house. @entity3's mother, @entity2, drove him to the playground. @entity3 met up with @entity4 and @entity0. @entity3 ran to the monkey bars. @entity4 ran to the slide. @entity0 ran to the swings. @entity2 sat on a bench near the monkey bars and read a book. She wanted to finish the book for a long time and wanted to try to finish right now. Around @entity1, it started to rain. @entity2 quickly put her book inside of her jacket to keep it dry. Afterwards, she called @entity3 and his friends over and told them it was time to go. @entity3 and @entity4 ran to @entity2 to follow her to the car. @entity0 tried to run to @entity2 but tripped and fell. He scabbed his knee. He was in a lot of pain. @entity2 told @entity3 and @entity4 to get inside of the car. She ran to @entity0 to check on him. @entity2 had a bandage in her pocket and put it over @entity0' scab. She then helped @entity0 get to the car. The next day, @entity3 asked @entity0 if he was okay from the fall at the playground. @entity0 said he was okay and wanted to go play at the playground again soon.
