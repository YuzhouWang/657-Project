A rabbit was hopping around, following all the smells he could smell. He had a great nose, smelling carrots, bushes, flowers, and other animals. He smelled melons and he smelled a dish of ice cream. Rabbits do not like ice cream, so he moved to the flowers faster. And he did not really like to snack on melons either. He saw friends, the duckling and the mother duck, but he was moving too fast to get to the flowers. He could smell the flowers from a long way away. He kept hopping to reach them, faster and faster. One hop, two hops, three hops. On his third hop he always bounced a little higher. He finally smelled the flowers close, so he hopped a little bit faster. The flowers were in sight. He went up to them and smelled longer and harder than ever before. A wonderful smell at last.
