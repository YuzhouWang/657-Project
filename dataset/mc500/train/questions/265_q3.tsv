@entity2 was excited for the treasure hunt.  He called up his friends to help him find all of the items on the list.  First he called @entity1.  @entity1 said he would come right over to help him find items.  Next he called @entity0.  @entity0 said he could help, but had to finish breakfast first.  Finally he called @entity3 and @entity4.  They were twins and were excited to join the treasure hunt.  Finally, all his friends arrived.  They were ready to look for the treasure hunt items.  The items on the treasure hunt list were a cup, coin, apple, bell, mitten, and rock.  The boys spread out in all directions, looking for the items.  @entity2 found an item first.  He found the rock.  @entity1 found a coin on the sidewalk.  He also found a mitten.  @entity0 found an apple in the yard.  @entity3 and @entity4 found a cup.  All that was left to find was the bell.
