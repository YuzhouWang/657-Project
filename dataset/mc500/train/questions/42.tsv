@entity0 was excited today because she was going to make her favorite meal! There were three things @entity0 had to do to get ready to make her favorite meal. First, she had to go to the store. Second, she had to cook her meal. Third, she had to eat it! @entity0's favorite meal was pizza, but she liked to make it at home all by herself. First, she went to the store. @entity0 bought four things: a pizza crust, tomato sauce, cheese and pepperonis. She put it all in her car and drove it home! Next, she turned on her oven and put the sauce on the pizza crust. She sprinkled the cheese all over the pizza and then put the pepperonis on top. @entity0 put the pizza in the oven for half an hour. When she took it out, it was done! @entity0 was very happy. She ate Three slices of pizza and went to bed.
