@entity0 was playing his favorite song.  The song was about a flower.  @entity0 stopped singing and went outside.  A single star was out in the night sky.  @entity0 got hungry and went inside to get a biscuit.  He also had jam with it.  He did not want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.  @entity0 sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.  @entity0 walked over to the living room.  On his way there, he put a napkin in the trashcan.  When he was in the living room, it started to rain.  It stopped raining and @entity0 walked all the way to the store.  When at the store, @entity0 had a good laugh at a very silly looking dog.  @entity0 heard it start to thunder.  @entity0 looked outside to see if it was raining again, and it was not.  @entity0 was happy he did not have to get wet walking home.  He went outside smiling.
