"Be home by dinnertime", @entity2's mother said as he left for school that morning. @entity2 was excited. Today was show and tell, and he planned to do his magic tricks for the whole class. Once he got to school, he could not wait until it was his turn. First up was @entity0, who brought her pet lizard. It could change colors to match whatever it was sitting on. The second to be called was @entity1, who showed the class a flower he had grown from seeds. Finally @entity2's name was called. He went to the front of the class. "For my first trick" he said, "I'll pull a hamster out of a hat". He had borrowed his sister Candice's pet hamster in order to do his trick. He showed the class his that the hat was empty, then he reached inside, into the secret space where the hamster was hidden. The hamster was gone. He heard a scream. Two girls were standing on their chairs, and the hamster was crawling toward the back of the class. The teacher made him stay after school as punishment, but at least he made it home by dinnertime.
