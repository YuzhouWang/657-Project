@entity0 got a new bicycle as a gift from one of his friends. He wanted to ride it so he looked outside his window to check the weather. There was lots of daylight and it was bright and sunny. The sky was clear and there was only a little bit of wind. He was excited that the weather was good because it meant that he can go and ride his bicycle. He took his bicycle down the stairway and told his parents that he wanted to go ride his bicycle for a little bit. After his parents said OK, he put on his helmet and went outside with his bicycle to ride it around the block. It was very fun and @entity0 had a great time riding his bicycle. While he was riding, he saw many interesting things like some insects that would fly around and some pets that were in peoples' backyards. He also saw some flowers growing in peoples' yards. He got back home from riding his bicycle and told his parents he had a great time.
