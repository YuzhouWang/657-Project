There was a beautiful butterfly that was flying around in a park. It was the only one in there. It was pink. It was very pretty. A small boy saw it and wanted to put it in his pocket. He had a naughty look on his face. First he walked slowly to where the butterfly was. The butterfly had been sitting by a flower. When it saw the boy nearby, it started to fly away. The boy quickly started to chase it. He laughed as he ran. It was a game for him. The butterfly was scared. It flew very fast and very high in the air. The boy jumped up. The butterfly would not stay still. He jumped as far up as he could. He tried many, many times but he could not reach the butterfly. The butterfly flew away. The boy could not catch the butterfly. He left the park with a sad look on his face. He wanted to cry but did not.
