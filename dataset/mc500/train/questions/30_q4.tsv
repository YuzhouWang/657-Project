@entity2 went to sit in her rocking chair. Today was her birthday and she was turning @entity1. Her granddaughter @entity3 was coming over in the afternoon and @entity2 was very excited to see her. Her daughter @entity0 and @entity0's husband Josh were coming as well. @entity2 had a lot to do before they got here, but she was very tired. After taking a nap for half an hour @entity2 got up and walked to the drier. She moved the dry clothes into a basket. Next, she took the clothes out of the washer and put them into the drier. She pressed the button on the drier to get it started then walked back out of the room. She also needed to feed her duck. The chickens in her backyard did not need to be fed as they belonged to her neighbor. Jack the dog had been fed earlier that morning and Becky the cat always had food in her bowl. After @entity2 finished feeding the duck she came inside and heard the telephone ringing. She answered the phone to hear @entity3's excited voice say "Happy birthday grandma!" @entity3 said they would be over very soon. @entity2 smiled because she loved her family more than anything. She was very excited. She sat back on her rocking chair and waited until her family arrived.
