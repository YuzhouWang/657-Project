@entity1 and @entity0 woke up earlier than normal. Their stomach were growling. They were ready for breakfast.They had gone to bed at their normal time, but they could not help being up now. So they woke up their father and went downstairs for breakfast. It was so early in the morning the sun was not even out yet. But their dad knew once the kids were up, there was no going back to sleep, so he got started.He gave them each a banana to start. He let them pick either a biscuit or toast. They chose toast. So he made wheat bread toast and put grape jelly on it. The quickly ate it and the orange juice they were given. They then each had a bowl of @entity2 before getting showered and dressed. They kissed their mom as she went to work and began enjoying the day off from school by playing in their rooms.Dad thought he'd done a good job feeding the kids. But in two hours, they both were asking for turkey sandwiches for lunch. With @entity1 and @entity0 so hungry so soon, their dad knew he was in for a long day.And a busy one in the kitchen.
