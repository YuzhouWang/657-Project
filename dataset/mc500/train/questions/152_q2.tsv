@entity2 wanted to go eat some pizza. He was a giant. He had eaten a hot dog and some carrots earlier that day, but it had been a long time. He was very hungry after a hard day of playing with his kitty. But @entity2 had a problem, he did know where he was. While playing with his kitten, he had left his yard and wandered into the deep woods that were near his house. It was getting dark outside, and @entity2 the giant was scared. He was also hungry. It had been a long time since @entity2 had eaten. Also, it was becoming cold, and @entity2 had left his jacket on the ground. There was some joy from the fact that he had his kitty. His name was @entity1, and was riding around on his shoulder. Still, @entity2 needed to find his way out of the woods fast.  It was at this time that @entity2 remembered that he had a flashlight in his pocket. With his flashlight, @entity2 could see the woods, and spot his house off in this distance. He ran home fast. Once he was home, @entity2 put down his kitty, and ordered a pizza. He was safe. He called his friends @entity0 and @entity3 to tell them about his big adventure, and sat down to play with his kitty @entity1.
