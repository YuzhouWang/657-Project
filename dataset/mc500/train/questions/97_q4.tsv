One morning @entity0 took her dog, @entity1, for a walk. @entity1 loved to walk outside. She loved to walk any time - morning, afternoon, or night. She liked to smell everything. This morning she smelled something new. It was another animal. It was not a squirrel. It was not another dog. Maybe it was a tiger! @entity1 sniffed around until she saw the other animal. It was not a tiger. It was a cat. The cat was watching @entity1. The cat was afraid @entity1 would try to bite her, so she climbed up a tree. @entity1 tried to follow her, but she could not climb up. Instead, she barked at the cat in the tree. @entity0 did not want @entity1 to scare the cat. She called @entity1 away from the tree. The cat watched them walk away. When they came back, the cat was gone. @entity1 remembered the cat. She started digging in the dirt under the tree. But there was no cat there. @entity0 and @entity1 went home for breakfast.
