A women went shopping for a dress to wear to her party.  She asked her parents to come along but her dad was busy.  Her mom joined her and brought a pear to eat later on as a snack.  They went to the first store and the woman tried on a dress.  It cut off right at the knee.  She liked the dress so much she bought it.  When they went back to their car they saw a bug had splashed on her window.  They thought nothing of it and wanted to go eat breakfast since it was nine in the morning.  Instead the restaurant was cooking peas.  The mom asked the cashier why they were cooking peas.  The cashier said because it was opposite day.  The woman and her mom wanted to eat the peas and bought steaks as well.  They were liking the peas and steak so much.  After eating, they got a vanilla milkshake and went to more stores to shop for fun.
