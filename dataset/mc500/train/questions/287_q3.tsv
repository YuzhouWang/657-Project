@entity6's aunt wanted to give her the best birthday present ever. So the day after @entity6's birthday, her aunt brought her to the pet store! @entity6 had been asking her aunt for a pet for a very long time. Many of her friends had pets, and she wanted one too. Her friend @entity0 had a hamster named @entity4. @entity2 had a rat named @entity3! @entity5 had two snakes and a lizard! @entity1 had a fish bowl with three fish. @entity6 could not wait to get her pet and tell her friends all about it. At the pet store, @entity6 and her aunt looked at all the animals they had. They saw puppies, kittens, fish, turtles, frogs, and bunnies. @entity6 saw a cute black puppy that she thought she might like. There was also a white kitten with blue eyes. But then @entity6 saw a gray bunny who was fluffy and soft, and she knew that she wanted the bunny as her pet. Her aunt helped her buy the bunny. They also got everything they needed for the bunny. They got a cage, a water bowl, and bunny food. @entity6 named her new bunny Fluffy.  @entity6 thanked her aunt, and she had the best birthday ever!
