@entity1 was a happy frog that lived in a beautiful pond by the river. She loved to play in the water and take a bath every day. But her friends, @entity4, @entity3, and @entity2 did not like to take baths. So one day when she was swimming alone, she met a new friend names @entity0. @entity0 loved to take lots of baths, so he became friends with @entity1. But @entity4, @entity3, and @entity2 did not like @entity0. So one day when @entity1 and @entity0 were swimming, @entity2 did something mean. She threw rocks and @entity1 and @entity0. @entity1's dad saw what happened and he was very mad. He went over and yelled at @entity2 for what she did. After that @entity2 did not throw any rocks, and @entity1 and @entity0 could swim together and take lots of baths. They were very happy since they could play in the water as much as they wanted without other frogs being mean to them.
