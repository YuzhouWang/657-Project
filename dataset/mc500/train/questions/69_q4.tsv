@entity0 was new in the neighborhood. She really wanted to meet some new friends. She was lonely and tired of playing with her toys all by herself. Her mother told her that the best way to meet new friends was to go somewhere where other kids are at. She remembered seeing a park on the corner when they were moving in. She asked her mother if she could go to the park. Her mother walked her down the street to the park. When @entity0 got to the park she was not happy. There was no one there. She sat on a swing and looked at the ground. It seemed like this was going to be another lonely day. @entity0 heard a noise and looked up. There was a girl coming down the hill. She smiled, but she was a little scared. What if she was not nice? That would make her sad. @entity0 was so happy when the girl walked up and said, "Hi, my name is Julie. What's yours?"
