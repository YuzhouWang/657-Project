One hot afternoon in the summertime a family and their dog were getting ready to have a dinnertime picnic in the park. The dishes in the picnic included peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, watermelons, potato salad, and chocolate cookies. When they got to the park the father, @entity8, was looking for a good place to have the picnic. While they were walking they bumped into their neighbors, @entity1 and @entity0, and their twins, @entity3 and @entity6 and their dog Emile. @entity1 explained that it was the twins' birthday and they were celebrating by going out for a walk. They said goodbye and kept looking for a picnic spot. He chose a nice spot under a tree that would keep the family cool. While setting up the picnic, the mother, @entity7, told the son, @entity2 to go play with their dog, @entity4, to pass some time until it was time for dinner. @entity2 found a stick and began to play fetch with @entity4 down the hill. Some time passed and @entity2 began to return to the picnic with @entity4. Along the way back he picked a flower to give to his mom because it was @entity5's day. When he arrived he gave the flower to his mom and she said, "Thank you so much, @entity2!" His mother poured him a cool and tasty glass of lemonade. It tasted extra good because it was so hot outside! @entity2 sat down and enjoyed the picnic with his family under the large tree.
