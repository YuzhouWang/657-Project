One upon a time there was a dragon named @entity0.  He was large and had big scales, but did not have claws or a mean look on his face like other dragons did.  He also did not have wings and could not fly.  @entity0 lived near a castle that had a princess trapped in it.  This castle looked and was guarded by an evil dragon named @entity1. The castle was old and dirty.  It was not clean or special like many castles are thought to look.  One day @entity0 thought that he was going to try to save the princess Linda when @entity1 was sleeping that night.  After sunset, he slowly walked around and climbed over the back wall.  After passing many sleeping guards, @entity0 put his nose near the princess's tower window. She climbed out on to it and they ran off.  During their escape, @entity1 woke up and started chasing them.  However, he was too sleepy to catch them.  @entity0 took the princess to a nearby safe town where she thanked him and said goodbye.
