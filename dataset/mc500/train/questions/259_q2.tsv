@entity3 lives in a big city with his mother and father. His father is called @entity0, and his mother's name is Clarissa. He likes to go to all the stores and look at the things inside. Sometimes if @entity3 sees something he likes, his parents buy it for him. Last week, they were in a store and @entity3 saw a ball that he wanted. @entity3's father bought it for him, and @entity3 was very happy. @entity3's grandmother does not live in the city. She lives on a farm. Her name is @entity2. Sometimes @entity3's parents take him to visit his grandmother. There are not many stores around where she lives. But @entity3 is always excited to see her, because there are many things there that are not found in cities. The first time he saw a cow, @entity3 was scared, because he had never seen a cow in the city. There are always a lot of animals near @entity3's grandmother's house. Sometimes there are chickens and pigs and ducks.  @entity3's favorite animal is @entity1. @entity1 is @entity2's dog. He is a friendly dog. He does not bark at the other animals. Sometimes @entity3 and @entity1 play with a ball. @entity1 likes to play with @entity3. Sometimes @entity1 does not like strangers, but @entity1 has seen @entity3 a few times, so now they are friends. @entity2 is a very good cook. She always makes @entity3's favorite breakfast: eggs, pancakes, and bacon. Sometimes @entity3's mother makes the same meals for him, but @entity2's food is always better. @entity3 is sometimes sad when he leaves @entity2's house. But he knows that he is going to return, so he is not sad for long.
