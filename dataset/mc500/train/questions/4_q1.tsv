The road to @entity1's house was long and winding. There were lots of tall trees and animals in the woods. The trip took a long time because @entity0 was walking in his new boots and he was not used to them yet. He could have taken a ride to @entity1's house, but that would not be as fun. @entity0 liked to collect insects on the way to his @entity1's house, so had picked the longer path. As he went along, @entity0 found more and more insects to add to his jar. His favorite was the lightning bug and he had found five of them total. He liked the moths too, but they were difficult to catch and took up a lot of space.Finally, @entity0 arrived at @entity1's house and knocked. @entity1 answered the door with a smile and welcomed @entity0 inside. They sat by the fire and talked about the insects. They watched the lightning bugs light up as night came.
