@entity0 and @entity6 were best friends. They had met when they were little and grew up together. @entity6 and @entity0 got a house to live in and painted the walls blue. Then they went to buy a couch. @entity1 worked at the couch store. @entity6 found a green couch that she liked. But the couch was too hard. @entity0 found a soft red couch. She showed it to @entity5 and they both thought it was very soft. @entity1 said he would help them move it and let them buy the couch. @entity0 and @entity6 went to another store to buy extra cushions. @entity4 worked at the store that had a lot of pillows to buy. @entity0 and @entity6 did not think @entity4 was nice. @entity4 did not help them. @entity0 found red pillows but @entity4 would not give them to her. @entity6 found pretty green pillows but @entity4 said they cost a lot of money. @entity0 and @entity6 went to another store where they met @entity3 and @entity2. @entity3 and @entity2 showed them a lot of pillows that were nice. @entity0 and @entity6 showed @entity2 and @entity3 the couch they had. @entity2 and @entity3 helped find pretty blue pillows for the red couch.  @entity0 and @entity6 were so happy they threw a party. @entity2 and @entity3 went to the party. @entity1 went too. @entity1 went to the party and gave @entity2 and @entity6 a rug. It was blue.  The rug matched the pillows.
