One morning, @entity0 woke up, much like she did every day. She threw the covers on the floor and rolled out of bed, yawning hugely. She walked to the window and said, "Hello there, Mr. tree!" at the big tree in the yard. It waved its branches back at her. She walked over to her fish bowl next. "Hello there, Mr. @entity1!" But wait. Where was Mr. @entity1? The bowl was empty--oh, the rocks and water and tiny castle were all there alright, but the pretty blue fish with the long shiny tail was nowhere to be seen. @entity0 was very worried. She liked Mr. @entity1 very much. She looked all around her desk, but here was not there. Then she looked on the floor behind the desk--and there he was! He was covered in dust bunnies and not moving. @entity0 picked him up and put him back in the bowl. And what do you know? He shook himself off and started swimming around again!
