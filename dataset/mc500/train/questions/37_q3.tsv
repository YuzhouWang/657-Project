On Sunday, our family went for a picnic.  @entity3, dad, @entity2, @entity1 (our dog), and I got in the van and drove to the park.  @entity2 and I played fetch with @entity1.  @entity0 fired up the grill and made some hamburgers.  @entity3 made some salad.  @entity3 asked me to spread the picnic cloth.  @entity1 wanted to help me too.  Once the burgers were ready, we sat down to eat.   They were delicious, I ate two!  @entity2 only ate one hamburger.  I did not like the salad because I do not like carrots.  @entity3 says they're good for me.  @entity1 does not like carrots either.  After lunch, I played with dad and @entity2 played with mom and @entity1.  @entity0 and I were flying a kite.  @entity2 and mom played with flowers.  Then we packed up the van and went home.  I fell asleep on the way home.  Sunday was a lot of fun.  I want to do it again!
