@entity0 the watermelon was a very special type of watermelon. He did not have any seeds. He was green and he had stripes. All of his cousins had seeds, but he did not have any. He felt very left out. He could not thing of why he was different. His mom told him it was because he was a very special watermelon. She also tells him she loves him the way he is. But @entity0 did not think it was a good thing. He wished he could be like everyone else and have seeds. One day, he rolled out to the lawn and looked at all of his new cousins growing in the garden. He rolled around until he found a little baby watermelon that did not have any seeds either. He sat next to him and talked to him. He told him that he was very special, and was excited for him to be picked off the vine and be his special best friend. He would name him @entity0, Jr.
