There was a very friendly cow named @entity0 who loved to walk around the town and eat lots of grass. @entity0 loved grass so much, but she hated when she got a mouthful of weeds or dirt. One day when @entity0 was looking for some tasty grass, she spotted a pretty purple flower. Without thinking she ate the flower and got very sick. @entity0 walked home feeling very bad, and when she passed some green, orange, and red flowers, she did not dare to eat them. When @entity0 got home her mom asked her why she was so sick. @entity0 could tell her mom, dad, and brothers @entity2 and @entity1 would be mad at her if she said she ate a flower so she lied. She told them that a bee stung her and she was not feeling good today. Then she lay down in her bed and took a long nap to feel better.
