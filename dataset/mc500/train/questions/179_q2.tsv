Once there was a group of adventurers who went on an adventure in a place named Hyperion where there was a lot of snow. Their names were @entity4, @entity3, and @entity1. @entity4 and @entity3 were from @entity5, but @entity1 was from @entity0, @entity2. Because of where he was from, he was not used to the cold. To stay warm, @entity1 wore three jackets. One day during their adventure the men saw a strange cave. @entity4 and @entity3 wanted to go inside, but @entity1 was afraid. He had heard that a horrible bug monster named @entity6 lived in the caves of Hyperion. @entity4 and @entity3 told him that was only a fairy tale. They told him the only thing he really needed to worry about was hitting his head on a rock in the cave. Finally they got @entity1 to go into the cave. Inside there were lots of tunnels. They chose the middle tunnel. The tunnel went down into the earth. After a long time it ended. The men were in a huge room. There were beautiful ice shapes on the walls.
