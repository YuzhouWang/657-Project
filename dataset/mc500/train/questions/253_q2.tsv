@entity0 loves nature. She loves trees, flowers, grass, singing birds, the sky, and even the wind. She spends a lot of time lying on the grass, looking at the sky, and listening to the birds. One of @entity1's favorite things to do is to look at the shapes of the big, fluffy clouds. "That one looks like a flower. And that one looks like a boat. There's one that looks like my dog!" she says to herself. She is always surprised and happy to find a new shape. @entity1's most favorite thing to do is to look at the flowers and bugs that visit her place. She watches and studies all the butterflies, bees, ants, spiders, and even worms that are in her backyard. @entity1 has a wonderful backyard. Her mother has a big, beautiful garden that she helps to take care of. This is how @entity1 is learning to grow and take care of plants. The garden makes the whole yard look beautiful and smell wonderful. And the garden brings in all kinds of amazing birds and insects. @entity1 has lots of pictures of the birds and bugs that come into her backyard. She feels like a kid scientist. Someday, she wants to become a real scientist. Then she can learn all about plants, bugs and nature.
