The First DaySeven year old @entity3 grabbed his mother's hand as they entered the school. It was his first day at the new school and he was afraid. This school was bigger than the one he went to before, and there were so many kids everywhere. Still, @entity3 wondered if he would make any friends here. He was always a little shy, and the few friends he had were now far away in another city."Here we are," @entity3's mother said as she looked at a classroom door. "Room One hundred and @entity2. This is your new classroom, @entity3. Let's go meet your new teacher."They entered the classroom and walked over to the teacher, who was writing on the blackboard. "Hello. I'm Mrs. @entity1," @entity3's mother said as she greeted the teacher with a smile.The teacher looked up and smiled at Mrs. @entity1 and said, "I'm @entity0. It's nice to meet you Mrs. @entity1." Then she looked at @entity3 and said, "Hello. And who is this nice young man?""This is my son, @entity3. He started at this school today, and is in your class," Mrs. @entity1 said as she smiled had put her hand on her son's head."Well @entity3, class is about to begin and then you can meet all the nice children here," said @entity0. "Say goodbye to your mommy and then we can get started." @entity3 gave his mother a big kiss and waved goodbye as she left the classroom. Then the teacher took him to his seat at his new desk.Everything went well on that first school day. @entity3 made twelve new friends. He ate a good lunch had a banana and popcorn for snacks.
