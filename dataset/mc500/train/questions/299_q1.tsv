This summer @entity0 and his friends went to @entity1 camp for two weeks. At camp they had lots of fun activities like swimming, wood carving, and telling ghost stories. At camp there were not any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals. One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp. But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.At first, @entity0's mom was very worried about letting @entity0 go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys. She was even worried that he would not shower or take a bath for the whole two weeks. But @entity0's scout masters explained to @entity0's mom that the camp leaders were very serious about taking care of the campers and that everything would be perfectly safe for @entity0. @entity0 promised to call home at least every two days. So in the end @entity0's mom let @entity0 go to camp.
