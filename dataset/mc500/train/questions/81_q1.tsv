@entity0 was right next to his close friend when he heard a strange noise. He was afraid of this noise so he built a shield. From behind the shield, @entity0 had to shout, "Who is there?" Then he saw an animal that had a green stripe across its back. @entity0 was scared. Then the animal stepped into a plate filled with frosting and the animal slipped and fell on the ground. @entity0 had to be quiet so he could get to the out and to the playground without the animal hearing him. After he was far enough away, @entity0 started to run very fast. He ran and ran until he finally made it to the playground where he hid for the rest of the day in the sand box. When he felt safe he called his mother and had her pick him up and get away. When his mom got there, @entity0 said, "Thank you for coming to get me mom, I was so scared." His mom told him, "You are very welcome @entity0. I'm here whenever you need me."
