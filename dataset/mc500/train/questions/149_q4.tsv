@entity3 wanted a phone, so he asked his @entity2 if he could have one because phones are very expensive. @entity3 told his @entity2 that he could do extra chores for money to buy one. @entity3's @entity2 told him that a phone is very expensive, much more expensive than the toys he normally buys with his chore money. But @entity3 still really wanted a phone. @entity3's @entity2 came up with an idea and told @entity3 to pray for one. Since she could not help him, maybe God could help him. That night @entity3 prayed before bed and asked if he could somehow have a phone. The next day @entity3 was playing bat and ball with his brother @entity0 and sister Lucy. He saw something shine from the ground. He found a phone lying there. He ran and took it to his @entity2 who checked the phone, and after a quick clean found the phone worked. She told @entity3 that someone must have lost the phone and she'll call them to tell them they have found the phone. @entity3 sat in the kitchen as @entity3's @entity2 called the number in the phone. A lady called @entity1 answered. After telling the lady the story of @entity3 and his praying, the lady was so touched that she told @entity3's @entity2 to give the phone to @entity3.
