@entity0 had the best grandmother ever. She was very nice because she would always help @entity0 when he needed help with his homework. She would sit down with @entity0 in the kitchen and help him with his spelling every night. Then she would go back to the living room and watch television when he worked on his math. After that she would cook @entity0 a big dinner, and they would both eat it together before @entity0's mom and dad came to pick him up. When @entity0 went home he would sometimes call his grandmother to say hello. Even when she was sleepy she would talk with him and tell him a bedtime story. One time she even told him a story about his grandfather who had been a farmer. @entity0 loved this story because he never got to meet his grandfather. One day he wanted to be like him and be a farmer.
