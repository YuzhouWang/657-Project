@entity1 and @entity2 were two young dogs. They were happy because it was now the summer and they could play outside more often. Today @entity1 and @entity2 were running around in their big backyard. They had fun barking at many things. They barked at squirrels. They barked at a bus. They barked at the mailman. They barked at a weird bug. They barked so much, they were never quiet! The neighbor was a grumpy old man. His name was @entity0. @entity0 threw a shoe at them because they were barking too much. He could not take a nap because they were so loud. @entity0 got too angry and @entity0 throws things when he gets too angry. The shoe missed both @entity1 and @entity2, but they barked a little less. Now they ran even faster. After a very long time, they began to get tired. They sniffed around the edges of the yard and found some old watermelon. That's a good snack for young dogs like @entity1 and @entity2! Next, they rolled around in the dirt. Then they chased their tails. Finally, their mom came out and told them to come inside. They were so dirty, they needed a bath. @entity1 loved baths and jumped right into the tub. @entity2 was scared and ran away to hide. After a little bit, his mom found him and he got a bath in the end, too.
