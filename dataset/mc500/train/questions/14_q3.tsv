@entity0 was spending a few days over her grandma and grandpa's house. @entity0 and her grandpa went to the park on Thursday morning. She had so much fun with him, and they were smiling the whole time! He pushed her on the swings, then helped her go down the slide. After they left the park, they went back to her grandpa's house. @entity0 asked her grandpa to make her lunch because she was starving! He told her that he could make her a few things. She could choose between chicken and pasta, beef and rice, or pizza and salad. @entity0 asked him to make her chicken and pasta. They ate lunch together at the kitchen table. The next day, @entity0 and her grandma went to see a movie at the movie theater. There was a new cartoon movie about cats and dogs that she could not wait to see! They ate popcorn and candy, and @entity0 had some juice. On Saturday, @entity0's grandparents brought her back home to her mom and dad. They were so excited to see her! @entity0 spent Sunday with her mom, dad, grandma, and grandpa. They had a big picnic, and it was a great end to the week.
