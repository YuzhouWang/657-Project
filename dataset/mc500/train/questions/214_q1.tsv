On the third day of November, @entity1 and @entity0 went to the store. They wanted to get some food for a new recipe. It was late in the afternoon, but they wanted to eat the food soon at dinner. To save time they split the list in half. @entity1 was to get the pasta and tomato sauce, and @entity0 was to get the vegetables and juice. They went their separate ways in the store, and made plans to meet in the checkout line in half an hour.  On her way to the fruit and vegetable section, @entity0 ran into her friend @entity2. @entity2 had bought a pet bunny for his friend and wanted to buy it some food. He asked @entity0 what he needs to feed the bunny. @entity0 told him lettuce and carrots, so he put Five heads of lettuce in his basket along with one bag of carrots. @entity2 said goodbye to @entity0 and went to the front of the store to buy his vegetables. Now it was time for @entity0 to pick out the vegetables she would buy for dinner. She wanted to make a salad, so she bought spinach, Two big red tomatoes, a box of mushrooms, and Three cucumbers. @entity0 then went to where they kept the juice and grabbed a big bottle of lemonade.@entity0 went to the front of the store and met @entity1. They handed their items to the sales clerk so that they could buy them. The total cost of the food was Two0 dollars. As a gift to @entity0, @entity1 paid for the food and said happy birthday. As a gift he would be cooking her dinner.
