When I was a little girl I lived in a place with no winter. It was always warm there. It never got cold. It never snowed. Sometimes it rained. Sometimes there was wind. But there was no snow on the trees or on the ground. There was no snow falling on our heads. There was no snow to make a snowman. My teacher's name was Mrs. @entity2. One day in December, Mrs. @entity2 told us that we were going to make a snowman. We were excited! We wanted to see a snowman. We knew how a snowman looked. We knew a snowman was made of three snowballs. A snowman had to have a carrot nose and black eyes and buttons. A snowman had a hat and a scarf. We knew all these things. Mrs. @entity2 asked us to bring everything we needed to our classroom to make a snowman. @entity1 said, "I can bring the hat and the scarf." @entity3 said, "I can bring a carrot for the nose." @entity0 said, "I can cut out some black circles for the eyes and the buttons." @entity4 asked, "But who can bring the snow?" Mrs. @entity2 said, "I know what to do."The next day all the children brought the things for the snowman. We did not know where Mrs. @entity2 would get the snow. Then she showed us. Our snowman is made of three bushes! Three bushes painted white! We put all the things on the bushes and it looked like a real snowman.
