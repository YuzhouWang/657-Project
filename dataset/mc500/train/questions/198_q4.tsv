@entity3 was excited. So excited that he ate and got dressed before his dad even woke up. Today he was going to the store to spend the money his grandma had sent him for his birthday. When @entity0 was finally ready to go, @entity3 hurried to the car. Today was extra special because none of his sisters were going with them. His older sister @entity4 was visiting her best friend. His younger sister @entity1 was going to a movie with their mom. So today was a special day, only @entity3 and @entity0 being guys together. Once they reached the store, @entity3 walked slowly down each aisle, looking at all the toys and trying to find the best one. @entity2 superheroes, colorful games, and a bright blue ball all caught his eye, but @entity3 kept looking. Finally he saw it, hiding on the bottom shelf. The most perfect toy- a shiny, white jeep. @entity3 rushed to pick it up and show it to his dad. His dad thought the jeep was a great toy. And @entity3 had enough money to buy it. The clerk took @entity3's money and placed the perfect car into a bag for the boy. As they drove home, @entity3 looked into the bag at his dream toy several times, to make sure it was real. And all afternoon he pretended to drive his jeep around the house. This had been the best day ever!
