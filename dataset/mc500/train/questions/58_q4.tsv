It was movie night at @entity0's house.  He was looking forward to watching a movie.  He wondered what sort of movie it would be.  Would it be a cartoon?  Would there be knights? He really likes to watch movies about spaceships.  His sister likes to watch movies about animals.  Tonight they would watch his father's favorite type of movie.  His mother came home and put it on the table. After dinner @entity0 cleared away the plates from the table.  It was his sister's turn to wash the dishes.  His father went to read the newspaper.  His mother began to make popcorn.  She made a big bowl of popcorn.  There was plenty for everyone.  She put lots of butter on it.  @entity0 was excited he went to sit on the striped rug in front of the television.  His sister came and sat next to him.  His parents sat on the couch.   The dog climbed on to the blue chair.  The movie was about cars.  @entity0 had a great movie night.
