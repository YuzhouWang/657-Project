One day the @entity4 family went to the zoo.  @entity1 rode her bike from place to place.  @entity5 @entity4 crawled everywhere he went.  Their parents, @entity7 and @entity0 @entity4, walked.  After visiting many animals they all met up at the monkey cage.  There was a long line to feed the monkeys.  The line was so long that @entity5 fell asleep for a bit.  Finally, it was time for the @entity4 family to feed the monkeys. The daughter, @entity3, feed the monkeys a banana.  The son, @entity5, fed the monkeys a cracker.  The mother, @entity7, fed the monkeys a piece of cheese.  The father, @entity0, fed the monkeys an apple. After the monkeys were done eating the zoo worker told them to pick their favorite treat, and give the person who gave it to them a hug.  The monkeys all hugged @entity5.  @entity5's parents were proud of him for picking the treat he liked best.  As a reward, they gave him a special prize.  @entity5 got the bike he had always wished for.  At the end of the day he left the zoo a very happy child.
