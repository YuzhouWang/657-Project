"How are you asleep? It's six in the morning!""Hello @entity0," I said.  My dad thought waking me up early for father-son time was a treat.  I wished we could hang out at night instead. He sat in the chair at the foot of my bed with an enormously cheesy grin on his face, with a big shopping bag on his lap."What's in the bag, @entity0?""I bought you some presents! You're a growing young man, and it is only right that you pick a sport." @entity0 dug through the bag, and pulled out a football and a baseball. "Any of these look good?""@entity0, you know all I want in life is to join the circus! Why ca not you let me be myself?"@entity0 leaned in closer to me, a serious look on his face. "Son, when I was eight I wanted to join the circus too. But when I got to high school, everybody made fun of me. They told me I was dumb for not playing sports and dumb for practicing juggling all day. They told me that nobody would marry me if I did not give up my circus dreams.""Then how did you find Mom?""By giving up my dreams of circus juggling and playing football instead! @entity1 on, you'll like it."I slowly pulled myself out of bed and grabbed the football from @entity0's hand. I wanted to make him happy. But I wish he could've been happy with a dream where you did not get hit with things.
