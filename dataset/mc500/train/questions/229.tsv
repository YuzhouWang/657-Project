@entity0 was a young boy who was excited for his first day of school.  He jumped out of bed with a big smile on his face, ready for school.  He looked in the mirror as he put on his white shirt and blue jeans, and ran down the stairs to get breakfast.  His breakfast was waffles with syrup and eggs.  His favorite breakfasts are pancakes and cereal, but the waffles were good.  After eating all his food, he grabbed his lunch and ran out the door towards the yellow school bus.  He arrived at the bus stop and waited for the bus.  The bus was running late, but then he finally saw the bus pull up to the bus stop.  He did not want to wait one more second so he talked to the bus driver and then took his seat on the bus.  He then took a good look out the window and watched as the bus began driving him to the first day of school he had been waiting for.  Finally, the bus came to a stop.  The children all ran off the bus towards the elementary school.  @entity0 did not see many other second grade students so he walked to the doors alone.  Once he entered the school, he saw many of his friends from third grade and began talking to them.  Then the bell rang and @entity0's first day of school began.
