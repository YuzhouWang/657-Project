Today was an important day for @entity4: he was going to go to the pet store and pick out a pet to take home and live with him! @entity4 was worried that he would not find a pet that would like him better than the other pets, but he knew he would find the pet for him. The pet store had a big, white door and @entity4 opened it up and heard lots of barking! He saw a nice man standing next to the dogs who said that his name was @entity0. @entity4 said hello and petted the dogs. He really liked one of the dogs named @entity3, but @entity3 did not like him. @entity0 said that @entity3 was mean and did not like some people even when the people were very nice. @entity4 was a little sad, but he saw the next cage! There was a small, yellow dog in the cage named @entity2. @entity4 put his finger through the bars in @entity2's cage and @entity2 licked his fingers. @entity4 laughed, and asked @entity0 to let him play with @entity1. @entity4 and @entity1 played together in the grass outside of the store, and @entity4 was so happy. @entity1 loved @entity4, and @entity4 loved @entity1! @entity4 had some papers that he had to sign, and he showed @entity0 all of the toys and items he had bought to bring home with his new pet: @entity0 was so happy, too! @entity4 put his new friend on a leash and took @entity1 home with him, and they loved each other very much.
