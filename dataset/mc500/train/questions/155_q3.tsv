She bought a whole bunch, excited about how delicious her cupcakes would be for her cupcake party tonight!She went home and took extra care making her cupcakes that afternoon. She made them extra fluffy, sweet and delicious. She even pulled out her favorite sprinkles for her cupcakes, bright purple ones, which was her favorite color. She could not believe how amazing her cupcakes were going to be for the cupcake party!That night at the cupcake party, Ms. @entity0 showed everyone her plate of delicious cupcakes!
