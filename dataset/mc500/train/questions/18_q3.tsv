@entity0 woke up one morning and went outside to her back yard. She was in a hurry because it was @entity2's Day and she had to collect flowers before her mom woke up to give to her as a present. She was going to give her mom the biggest, most beautiful bunch of flowers her mother had ever seen. She knew where the best flowers were in her yard. She got a lot of different sized flowers. The red ones were big, the orange ones were small, and the green ones were in the middle. After @entity0 collected all of the flowers, she went inside and tied them together with string. After that, she had to hide the flowers in a secret spot. She hoped her baby sister Morgan, who was still in diapers, would not find the flowers and eat them. @entity0 was worried, so she hid them in a new spot that was up higher. Finally, her mother woke up at @entity1:Thirty AM, and @entity0 was excited! @entity0 gave her mother the flowers. Her mother's favorite was the red one.
