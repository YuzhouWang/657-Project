It was Saturday afternoon and @entity0 was bored. He had been watching TV all day. He told his dad, "There's nothing to do!"  @entity0's dad said, "I think the newspaper is here. Maybe we can find an idea in the newspaper." @entity0 looked outside the window and saw the newspaper by the door. On the front was a picture of an elephant.  He picked up the newspaper and brought it to his dad.  @entity0 and his dad read the story.  The circus was in town!  @entity0 had never been to the circus. He asked his dad, "Can we go?" "Yes, we can,' @entity0's dad said, 'but first you need to feed your goldfish."  @entity0 fed his goldfish some goldfish food. He promised to bring it some peanuts from the circus for later.  @entity0 and his dad went to the circus.  The people and animals at the circus did lots of tricks. The elephant even went down a slide!  @entity0 and his dad ate lots of peanuts.  There were not any peanuts left to bring home to the goldfish.  @entity0 and his dad had a lot of fun at the circus.
