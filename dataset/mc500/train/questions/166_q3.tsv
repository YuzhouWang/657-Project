There was once a little fairy named @entity1 who lived in an old willow tree. The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest. @entity1 loved to fly around the forest with her best friend @entity0 the Bat. @entity0 was a very forgetful bat. One day @entity1 and @entity0 were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when @entity0 shouted, "Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.""Do not worry," said @entity1. "I am going to wait here for you until you get back."With that, @entity0 flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and @entity0 still had not returned. "Hmm," thought @entity1, "I wonder where @entity0 went off to." @entity1 flew off to find her best friend.Soon, she heard a voice calling from down below. "Help me! I'm stuck!" @entity1 looked down. Sure enough, it was @entity0! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. "Do not worry, I am coming to save you!" cried @entity1. @entity1 swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull @entity0 out of the thick mud. @entity0 grabbed the end of the stick that @entity1 held out to her. After some heavy tugging, @entity0 was free."Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck.""No problem," said @entity1. "That's what friends are for."

@placeholder was @entity1 glad to help @entity0 the bat
