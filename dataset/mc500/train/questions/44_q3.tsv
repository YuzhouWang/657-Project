It was a terrible day to live in the zoo again for @entity3. It was not a terrible day for @entity2, the monkey next to him, or @entity4, the giraffe down the sidewalk, or @entity1, the alligator in the pond, or for Bam the prairie dog, but it was a terrible day in the monkey cage for @entity3. @entity3 did not feel he belonged in the monkey cage because he was not a monkey. He was a sailor who had visited the zoo on vacation and fallen asleep on a bench right before closing time. The zoo worker saw how hairy he was and thought he was a monkey that had escaped from his cage, so they put him in a cage. @entity3 knew if he did not sleep so deep, none of this would have happened.  He tried to tell the zoo worker the next morning he was not a monkey, but the zoo worker knew monkeys liked to play tricks and thought @entity3 was a talking monkey that was trying to trick him. Soon, the zoo worker told others about the talking monkey, and @entity3 became famous. People came from all over to see him. When the zoo was closed at night @entity3 passed the time teaching the real monkeys how to sail.  One day @entity3 was asking the people watching him to shave him when @entity0, another sailor on vacation, who knew @entity3, saw him. When he did, the sailor yelled, "That's no monkey, that's @entity3!" The zoo worker saw his mistake and sent @entity3 away with @entity0 in time to join the boat to sail home.
