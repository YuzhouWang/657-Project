@entity3 the @entity0 was always getting in trouble. Sometimes he'd reach into the freezer and empty out all the food. Other times he'd sled on the deck and get a splinter. His aunt @entity1 tried as hard as she could to keep him out of trouble, but he was sneaky and got into lots of trouble behind her back. One day, @entity3 thought he would go into town and see what kind of trouble he could get into. He went to the grocery store and pulled all the pudding off the shelves and ate two jars. Then he walked to the fast food restaurant and ordered @entity2 bags of fries. He did not pay, and instead headed home. His aunt was waiting for him in his room. She told @entity3 that she loved him, but he would have to start acting like a well-behaved turtle. After about a month, and after getting into lots of trouble, @entity3 finally made up his mind to be a better turtle.
