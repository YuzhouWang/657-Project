@entity2 lay in his bed after a night of no sleep.  He was too excited for today.  There was a football game that he was going to play with his friends.  It would be him, @entity8, @entity4, and @entity1 competing with @entity6, @entity9, @entity5, and @entity0.  @entity6, @entity3, @entity5, and @entity0 were much bigger than them, and were big bullies at school. When @entity2 got up, he had the choice to eat cereal, candy, chocolate milk, or pizza.  He chose to eat cereal because he thought that eating something good for you would make him play better.   They were going to play at the school, but the school was closed.  They then went to the park, and got their teams set up.  @entity2's team got the ball first and they scored!  @entity6's team got the ball next, but they also scored.  Unfortunately, it started raining.  @entity7 was getting wet, and people were starting to get angry.  A fight soon broke out, and they all started fighting with each other.  Eventually, @entity2 yelled for everyone to stop.  They all stopped and chose to eat pizza together and forgive each other.  @entity2 then went home bruised and dirty, and his parents grounded him for getting into a fight.
