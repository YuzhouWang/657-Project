@entity3 was going on an adventure.  He was going to float down the river with his friends, @entity2 and @entity4.  They had been building a boat out of wood @entity4's father had given them for the last week.  The boys wanted to paint the boat because the brown wood did not look very good.  @entity3 wanted green, @entity2 liked purple and @entity4 said it would look good if it was red.  They had to call their friend, @entity0, to help choose.  @entity0 thought the same as @entity3 on the color so that is what they painted the boat.  To thank @entity0 for helping them choose the color, the boys invited her to come with them.  All four of them carried the boat through the vegetable garden in the back yard.  They were very careful not to step on any of the carrots, potatoes or green beans.  @entity3's mother had packed some food for them to eat as they floated down the river.  @entity1 was in a big basket.  There were peanut butter sandwiches, potato chips and cupcakes with strawberry frosting.  Each person had a job on the boat.  @entity3 was the captain.  @entity2 made sure the snacks did not get wet.  @entity0 watched for rocks ahead.  @entity4 had to steer the boat.
