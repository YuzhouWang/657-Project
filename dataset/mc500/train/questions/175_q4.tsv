There once was a zoo worker named @entity1.  He really liked his job that allowed his to meet new people every day and take care of zoo animals.  One day, @entity1 showed up at the zoo that he worked at and saw that a turtle had escaped!  He quickly picked up the radio and told all of the other workers to look out for the missing @entity0 named @entity3.  Because of this, the zoo had to close down for the whole day!  They were trying so hard, but still could not find any clue to where the turtle went.  Finally, a girl named @entity2 went on the radio and said that she found @entity3 eating lettuce in the Polar Bear cage.  She also told everyone that the Polar Bears were protecting @entity3!  For hours, the zoo team tried to find a way to get @entity3 out of the cage without getting hurt themselves.  @entity1 finally had an idea.  He was going to take a stuffed turtle from the gift shop, sneak into the cage, put the Polar Bears to sleep for a little bit, and then place the stuffed turtle where @entity3 was eating his lettuce.  @entity1's plan worked, but the Polar Bears woke up and were not happy!  They took the stuffed turtle and ripped it up!  @entity2 went to find some fish to make them happy again as @entity1 told @entity3 the turtle to never run off again.
