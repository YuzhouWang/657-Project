There was once a family called the @entity4. There was a dad, @entity3, a mom, @entity1 McAllister, and their two twins, @entity6 and @entity0 McAllister. This family was a family family, but when it came time to eat dinner, they sometimes argued. This is because different people liked different meals. @entity5 liked chicken most of all, and @entity1 liked vegetables. The twins, @entity6 and @entity0, preferred hotdogs, but @entity6 preferred ketchup, and @entity0 preferred mustard. When it came to every day dinners, they took turns eating what each person liked. However, when it came to special meals like thanksgiving, it was difficult for the family to choose what to have. There would be frequent fights between all of them on what they would eat. Finally, they all had the answer. They would invite their grandpa over, because their grandpa was a great cook and could make everyone's favorite food, including chicken, vegetables, and hotdogs. On Thanksgiving, everyone was happy.
