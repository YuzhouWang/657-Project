@entity2 and @entity1 live next door to a banana farm. One day as they were taking a walk, @entity2 asked @entity1 if she could smell the sweet bananas. @entity1 said yes and that she would love it if the farmer would give them some. @entity2's mouth watered at the thought of eating the golden yellow bananas. They then began walking to the farmer's barn to ask him if they could have some. When they arrived they saw a sign that said the farmer would be out until tomorrow night. He was also a singer and would be performing at a school two towns over in @entity0. Instead of waiting for the farmer to return so that they could ask for some bananas, @entity2 and @entity1 began walking around the farm to pick their own. As he was walking, @entity2 tripped on a rock. As he tried to stand back up he felt a sharp pain in his leg. He could walk, but it was very painful. @entity1 let @entity2 lean on her as they walked home. They knew it was a bad idea to go on the farmer's land without his permission and would never do it again.
