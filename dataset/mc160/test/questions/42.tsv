The Rover family goes to the park for a wonderful picnic. The Rovers are a family of dogs. @entity2 packs a lunch which includes lots of doggie treats like dog bones and chew sticks. @entity0 brings the dog toys - an old Frisbee and a shoe that can be used for some fun activities - so their puppies, @entity1 and @entity3, have games to play. It is a bright sunny day at the dog park. Lots of other doggie families are also at the park enjoying the nice weather. The Rovers see their friends, the @entity4, and invite them to join them for lunch. The two families eat and play together. Afterwards, it's nap time for the pups.  The adult dogs clean up the leftover food. They pack the extra food in doggie bags - and pack their baskets and head home. The day was a lot of fun for all the dogs. Next week they plan to go to the beach and they might invite the @entity4 to join them again.
