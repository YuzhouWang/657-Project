@entity2, rain everywhere!@entity1 and June were best friends; they played together every day.  One day when June came over to play it was raining.  @entity1 told @entity0 that the rain was mean.  "How is the rain mean?" asked June.  "It's everywhere!" said @entity1. "It's raining on the sidewalk, it's raining on the swings, it's raining on my outside toys!  It's even raining on my dog Dean!"  June started to giggle.  @entity1 did not like the rain, and @entity1 did not like that June that rain was funny!"It's not funny!" said @entity1.  June stopped giggling. "Do not be silly, @entity1. I do not think the rain is funny. I think that you are funny, @entity1! The rain is not mean; it's helping the plants and trees stay alive."  "Really?" said @entity1. "How is the rain helping the plants and trees?"June went to her backpack and pulled out a big book, the front of the book had a picture on a tree. June used the book to show @entity1 how the rain was good for the earth. When they were done reading the book, @entity1 smiled. "I still do not like the rain, but I guess it's ok sometimes."
