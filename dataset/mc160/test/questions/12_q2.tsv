@entity0 wanted to have a birthday party. She called all of her friends. She has five friends. Her mom said that @entity0 can invite them all to the party. Her first friend could not go to the party because she was sick. Her second friend was going out of town. Her third friend was not so sure if her parents would let her. The fourth friend said maybe. The fifth friend could go to the party for sure. @entity0 was a little sad. On the day of the party, all five friends showed up. Each friend had a present for @entity0. @entity0 was happy and sent each friend a thank you card the next week.
