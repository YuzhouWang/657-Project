@entity0 was at home playing with his toys. He was bored because he was playing with his same old toys. He had done everything he could do with his toys. @entity0 had his toys for a long time. @entity0 asked his mom if she could give him money. There was a new action toy that he saw on the TV that he really wanted to have. The action toy was of the superhero he loved the most. It was painted red with a blue bow and arrow. He wanted to go to the mall right away to get the toy because there was only one left in the store. His mom told him that she would take him to the mall later in the day. She told him he would have to eat his dinner first. @entity0 was very happy that he would get his new toy. After he ate dinner, @entity0's mom took him to the mall. On the way to the mall, there was a cat that was stuck in a tree. The fire truck blocked the street to save the cat. @entity0 became sad because he thought that he was never going to get his toy. The fireman saved the cat and moved the truck out of the way. @entity0's mom kept driving to the mall. @entity0 got his toy and he was happy.
