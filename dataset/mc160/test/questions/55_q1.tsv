@entity0 and @entity1 went to their grandma's house. They were going to stay there for two days. @entity0 was happy because she likes to play with the farm animals. She wanted to milk the cow. She also wanted to play with the baby pig. @entity1 wanted to stay in the house and bake sugar cookies. He also wanted to make fresh cocoa. When @entity1 started to make the cookies he saw that there was no milk in the fridge to make the cookies and cocoa. He walked outside and asked @entity0 to fill up the bucket with fresh milk from the cow. @entity1 used the milk to make the cookies and hot cocoa. @entity0 and @entity1 shared the cookies with their grandma. They ate all of the cookies and drank the hot cocoa in front of the TV. Their grandma promised to make them apple pie the next morning. She had picked a basket full of apples the day before.
