Once upon a time there was a bird named @entity1. She lived in a tree with her parents. One day @entity1 flew to her friend @entity0's tree nest, but she did not ask for her parents' permission. They were having lots of fun playing that the time passed by so fast. They played tag. They played hide and seek. They even played racing to see who could fly the fastest. @entity1's parents started to get very worried when she did not return home for dinner. They called neighbors and friends, and even called @entity0 but they did not hear the phone ringing. It was not until @entity0's mom called her down to eat that @entity1 saw that it was almost past dinner time. @entity1 told @entity0 she had to go home. When @entity1 got home her parents were crying and very upset because they thought something happened to her. @entity1 felt very bad for not telling her parents, and she said she would never leave without telling them again. Her parents forgave her and sent her to bed. @entity1 went right to sleep.
