@entity2 is a small boy in the town of @entity1. @entity2 thinks his town is the best place in the world, and out of all the places in @entity1, @entity2 loves to play in @entity0 the most. @entity0 is a small lake with fish, plants, and even little shells. @entity2's favorite part was the big rock in the middle of the lake. @entity2 lives pretty close to the lake, so he gets to go there a lot, but could never to get to the rock in the middle. @entity2's dad never lets him swim too far because @entity2 ca not swim very well.During summer, @entity2 told his dad that he wanted to get to the rock before break ended. @entity2's dad told him he had to try his hardest. If he did, then @entity2's dad would watch him swim every day. If @entity2 wanted to try and get to the rock, his dad would follow him there to make sure he was safe. @entity2's dad wrote this down in his notebook so he would not forget.After a week, @entity2 made his first try to get to the rock, and his dad followed him like he said he would. @entity2 did not make it to the rock before he got tired and had to turn around. He practiced even harder for the next two weeks and wanted to try again. So, a month after summer started, @entity2 tried to reach the rock again. This time, @entity2 gave it his all and got all the way to the rock. He was very happy, and his dad was very proud of his son's hard work. To celebrate, @entity2's dad carved @entity2's name and the date into a tree. This way, they would always remember @entity2's hard work.
