@entity1 did not eat breakfast. Because he did not eat breakfast he was very hungry and could not stop thinking about food. He was thinking about all of the things that he liked to eat the most. He was thinking about breakfast foods like bacon and eggs but he was also thinking about lunch and dinner foods like pizza and macaroni and cheese. @entity1 was even thinking about some of his favorite desserts like chocolate cake and cherry pie. He was even thinking about vanilla pudding and he does not even like vanilla pudding. @entity1 was so hungry that he was having a hard time playing with his friends. @entity1 was playing with @entity3, @entity2 and @entity0. @entity2 chose not to play. @entity1 was not having any fun because he was so hungry. @entity1 was playing hide and go seek with @entity3 and @entity0 but he could not find any good places to hide. @entity1 did not want to play hide and seek. If he had to play a game he wanted to play tag but what he really wanted to do was eat lunch.
