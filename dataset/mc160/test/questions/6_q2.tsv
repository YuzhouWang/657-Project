One day, @entity0 was taking her dog to the park when she saw a big ice cream truck.  It did not look like other ice cream trucks she had seen before, so she rushed to look at it.  Inside, she saw that this truck had many different flavors of ice cream that the other trucks did not have. This truck had chocolate, strawberry, banana and even mint flavors! She wanted to get some ice cream, but when she got to the truck she saw that she had no money. She remembered then that she left it at home. All the other children were going up to the truck, but @entity0 could not because she had no money. She rushed home with her dog at her side, and jumped across fences and ran across sidewalks as quickly as she could, trying her hardest to get home.  When she got home, she got her money and ran back the way she came to the ice cream truck, but it was gone. @entity0 was very sad. She went back home and... ...found that her Mom had bought ice cream for everyone!

@placeholder could not @entity0 buy ice cream
she forgot her money at home

her mom would not let her
the ice cream truck was too fast
she did not have enough money saved
