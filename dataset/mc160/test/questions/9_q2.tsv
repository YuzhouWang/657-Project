@entity2 and her brother @entity0 went outside to play.  They brought their dog @entity1 with them, too.  @entity1 was holding a bone in her mouth.  @entity0 threw a ball and @entity1 chased after it.  @entity2 laughed as @entity1 ran away.  @entity1 brought the ball back to @entity0.  Then @entity1 barked.  This time @entity2 threw the ball.  She was younger than @entity0, so the ball did not go as far.  @entity1 chased after the ball anyway, and @entity2 laughed again.  @entity0 smiled at his little sister.  @entity1 ran back to @entity2 and dropped the ball at her feet.  Then @entity1 wagged her tail and licked @entity2's face.  @entity2 giggled and scratched @entity1's ears.  Then @entity0 and @entity2's mother came outside holding a bar of soap.  She told them that it was time for dinner and they had to come inside and wash their hands.  Just then, @entity0 and @entity2's dad came home from work.  @entity0 and @entity2 ran to their dad.  They all walked inside together and @entity1 followed them in.  They would have to play ball tomorrow.
