My puppy is a boy puppy. His name is @entity2. He is white like snow. @entity2 has a dog house. It is blue. @entity2 likes his dog house. He sleeps in it at night.  If @entity2 is hungry I feed him puppy food. I also give @entity2 water.  @entity2 is a good puppy. He does what I tell him to do. @entity2 likes to play with our cat, His name is @entity0. They share toys. @entity2 and @entity0 watch my goldfish, @entity1. @entity1 swims round and round in his bowl.  My neighbor @entity4 lives next door. He has a fish, too. Its name is @entity3. That is because he swims very, very fast. @entity3 is black. @entity4 likes to climb in trees. He also likes to play tag.  I teach @entity2 tricks. He loves to learn to do tricks. When he does them well I give him a prize! @entity2 loves to get a prize. It is a tasty puppy treat! When I come home from school.  @entity2 meets me at the door. He is so happy to see me. I am happy to see him, too! After I finish my homework we play ball outside. @entity2 loves to run after the red ball. He brings it back to me each time I throw it. I love to play ball with @entity2. It is so much fun.  I love @entity2 and @entity2 loves me. We are best friends.
