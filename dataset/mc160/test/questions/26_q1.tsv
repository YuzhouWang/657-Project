@entity1 wanted a puppy. She asked her mommy and daddy every day for one. She told them that she would help take care of the puppy, if she could have one. Her mommy and daddy talked it over and said that they would get @entity1 a new puppy.  Her mommy took her to the dog pound so that she could choose one that she wanted. All the puppies at the dog pound need a loving home.   @entity1 went to every cage and looked each puppy in the eyes and talked to each one. After each one, she told her mommy, "No, this is not the one for me." Finally, she saw a black and white spotted one that she fell in love with. She screamed, "Mommy, this is the one!" Her mommy asked the worker to take the puppy out so that @entity1 could make sure. @entity1 and the puppy fell in love with each other right away. @entity1 and her mommy took the black and white spotted puppy home with them. @entity1 was so excited that she talked all the way home. After thinking hard, @entity1 had a name for her new puppy, @entity0. Now, @entity1 has a new best friend and they play together every day when @entity1 gets home from school.
