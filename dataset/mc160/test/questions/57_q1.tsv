@entity4 kissed her hamster named @entity3. She waved goodbye to her brother, @entity6. @entity4 ran out the door. @entity4's neighbor, Mrs. @entity1, said she would make banana pancakes for @entity4 for breakfast. @entity4 could also play with Mrs. @entity1's new puppy, @entity5. @entity4 saw a bowl with green beans, beets, and carrots from the store on the kitchen table.  @entity2, thought @entity4.  @entity4 liked the new puppy.  @entity5 had a funny smile. Mrs. @entity1 gave @entity4 a box of toys and told her to take @entity5 to the backyard. @entity4 was busy looking at the green tomatoes.  She turned around and saw @entity5 and Mr. @entity1's cat, @entity0. @entity0 and @entity5 were playing with the toys. @entity0 kicked a ball to @entity5 and @entity5 kicked the ball back. @entity5 got a toy fish out the box. @entity0 and @entity5 played catch with the toy fish.  @entity4 was laughing because she never saw a dog and cat play together.  Mrs. @entity1 came to the backyard.  She asked @entity4 if she wanted yogurt, apple sauce or chocolate pudding with her breakfast. @entity4 said she wanted yogurt. @entity4 went inside and ate her breakfast with Mrs. @entity1 and Mr. @entity1.
