@entity2 was very excited to go to the park. His dad always takes him to the park to play ball. He plays baseball with all his friends. When he got to the park @entity2 saw his friend @entity1. @entity1 had brought his new puppy to the park. The puppy was very cute. It was a white dog with black spots. @entity2 really liked @entity1's new dog, so did their other friends Janet and @entity0. @entity2 jumped up and down and told his dad how cool the dog was. The next day when @entity2's dad came home he had a brown box with him. He told @entity2 he had a surprise for him. @entity2 was so excited he could not even sit still. When @entity2's dad put the box down it began to move. @entity2 was a little scared but also really excited to see what was in the box. When @entity2 pulled open the top of the box a very small white dog, covered in black spots, jumped out of the box and into @entity2's lap and began to lick his face. @entity2 was so excited, he named the dog Jack.
