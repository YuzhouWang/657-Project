The king, @entity1, stood over his men who were tired from fighting. The dragons were not as tired as the men. He could not let any more pain happen to his men. He ordered the men to run away. The men went to the village. "Everyone must run for the hills." @entity2, the purple dragon let out a roar, and sent fire into the sky from his mouth. "That's right! @entity0 little man! @entity0!" @entity4 and @entity5, the grey and black dragons, cheered and celebrated the win. The dragons went to the river and started eating berries, and fruits. "Now we celebrate! We have what we want! Now we wo not be hungry anymore!" @entity2 cheered. "Good things are sure to come from this win over the humans!"@entity4, not so sure, watched the humans running for their lives.The villagers could only watch the dragons take food from their land, afraid. They went to pack their things. They would need to leave with the king, and his men. There would be no soldiers to protect them from the dragons. @entity3, women, and children all ran around in confusion trying to get away. Before long, the village was vacated. It was okay; the villagers found a new home in the hills.
