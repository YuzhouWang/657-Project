@entity0 made his mommy a special card for her birthday.  When he gave it to her, she smiled and said that it was beautiful.  His dad also gave her a card, but she did not smile the same way.  @entity2 did not look mad, but @entity0 knew that she was disappointed.   The next day, @entity0's dad drove him to school.  @entity0 said "@entity1, did @entity2 not like your birthday card?"   @entity0's dad said, "Well, son, sometimes I do not know what your mother likes.  I could have asked her or thought of something better."   Before @entity0 got out of the car, he asked his dad, "Can we go to get ice cream after you pick me up from school?"   "Sure, that sounds good to me," said @entity0's dad. After school, @entity0 and his dad went to the ice cream shop. @entity0 said, "Now we can get @entity2 the present!"   @entity0's dad said, "What present?  Did you have a secret plan?"   @entity0 giggled and ran to the plant store nearby.  @entity0 remembered that when @entity2 took him to his grandma's house, she told @entity3 that she always wanted to have a lily plant.  They found a lily plant in the store.  The woman who worked at the store asked, "Do you want to put this in a pot?"   @entity0's dad told @entity0, "Let's get the yellow pot, because that's @entity2's favorite color."   When they got home, @entity0's mommy came out of the kitchen.  She saw the lily in the bright yellow pot on the table.  @entity0 saw her smile, only this time it was the same smile he saw when he gave her the card.  @entity0 smiled too because he knew that @entity1 made her very happy.
