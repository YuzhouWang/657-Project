@entity5 had a son that was named @entity6. @entity6 owned the only red dog. There was a blue dog named @entity1. The red dog was named @entity3. @entity6's mother and @entity5's wife was named @entity4. They all lived in a tree. There was a family down the street. They were a couple named @entity0 and @entity2. @entity5 hated his neighbors. One day @entity5 went to @entity0's house and threw toilet paper all over his trees. @entity0 got back at @entity5 by stealing his son's dog. This is how the long fight between @entity0 and @entity5 began. It lasted for ten years until @entity5 passed away from a bad heart attack. @entity0 knew he needed to say sorry to @entity5's wife for the years of trouble.
