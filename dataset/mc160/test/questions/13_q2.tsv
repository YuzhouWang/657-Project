@entity0 woke one morning to the sun shining and the birds singing.  He had a bird that would sit outside his window that he named @entity5. He really liked @entity5 and he fed her some bread every morning. When he was done feeding @entity5 he would go and feed his best buddy ever, @entity4, a big hairy dog. @entity2 really loved @entity4 and hung out with him all day, every day. Today he thought they would go fishing and enjoy the sunshine. @entity2 found his fishing pole, some worms, and a little lunch for the day. Off @entity2 and @entity4 went for the day. When they got to the fishing hole @entity4 ran over to a rock and started barking with his hair standing up. @entity2 ran to see what @entity4 had found. Under the edge of the rock was a huge green toad. @entity2 laughed and laughed at @entity4 and calmed him down then picked up the toad. @entity4 was very interested and licked the toad. @entity4 found a new friend. @entity2 took the toad home with them and named him Zoe the @entity1.
