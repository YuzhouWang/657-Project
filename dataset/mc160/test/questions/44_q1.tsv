One morning, @entity0 woke up very excited. He was excited because it was his birthday. He went downstairs to eat breakfast.  When he got downstairs his mom said, "Happy Birthday." "Thank you!" @entity0 said. "Am I going to have lots of presents?" he asked his mom.  "Yes, @entity0. When your friends come over for your birthday party you'll get lots!" "Hooray!" @entity0 said, eating his breakfast.  Later that day, @entity0's friends came over for his birthday party, and they brought over lots of presents.  They ate cake and ice cream. They played games like tag and played with a football.  After they were done playing @entity0 got to open his presents. He saw lots of presents. Red ones, blue ones, tall ones, round ones.  "Thank you!" @entity0 said, as he started to open his presents. He got a basketball, a robot toy, a new bike and some super hero toys! After all of @entity0's friends left, @entity0 fell asleep very fast because of the exciting day he had and he was happy he got all of those nice things.
