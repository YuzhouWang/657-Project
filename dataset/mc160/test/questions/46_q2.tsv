Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named @entity0. He was a very friendly giraffe and he was cute, too. He had beautiful orange and yellow markings and he loved to play with his friends, but @entity0 had a problem. His neck was really short, so he could not reach the tall plants and his mommy and daddy had to get all of his food for him. One day, @entity0's friend @entity1, invited him over for a sleepover party. It sounded like so much fun, but @entity0 was too embarrassed. He did not want everyone to laugh at him at feeding time when he could not reach the food by himself, so he said he could not come to the party @entity1 was a really good friend and he knew that @entity0 wanted to come to the party, so he came up with a plan. That afternoon, @entity1 gathered all the little giraffes in the neighborhood and they spent the day together collecting food. They then went to @entity0's house and showed him all the food they had gathered for the party and once again invited him along. He happily said yes and they all had a wonderful time.
