@entity5 was riding his bike home from school.  Then he saw @entity4 riding her bike in front of him.   @entity5 yelled, "@entity2, @entity4!"  Then he rode faster to catch up with her.  @entity4 said, "@entity5! @entity2!  Where are you going?" "I'm going to the empty lot on @entity0 to ride my bike.  The other kids are going to be there.  Do you want to come?" "Sure," said @entity4. @entity5 and @entity4 rode to @entity0, to the empty lot.  The empty lot did not have a house on it.  Instead, it had big hills of dirt, and it had trees cut down on the ground.  There was a low part that became a pond after it rained.  The lot had been empty for a couple of years, because times were bad and the builder could not find a buyer for another house.  The kids had ridden their bikes over the hills of dirt, around the cut trees, and through the muddy pond. There were bike trails all over the empty lot.  There were even places where the kids could jump their bikes.   There were three other children riding their bikes at the empty lot when @entity5 and @entity4 arrived: Lana, @entity1 and @entity3.  @entity4 said, "I am calling my mom to let her know that I'm here."   @entity5 said, "That's a good idea.  Can I use your phone when you're done?" @entity4 said "Sure!  Keep it for now.  I'm going to go on the jump path.  I was scared to try it last time.  I do not want to break my phone if I fall.  I'm leaving my backpack here, too." "Okay." said @entity5.  "I'll watch.  You'll do good."
