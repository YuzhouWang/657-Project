@entity1 gets an allowance from her parents every week for different chores she does every day. The big chore she must do is to feed the dog after school.  @entity1 had a busy day at school and had many tests to complete.  When she got home, she forgot to feed her dog, @entity0.  Her parents had to feed the dog later.  The next day, she forgot again.  She saw her parents were feeding @entity0 for her each night that she forgot to do it.  @entity1 stopped doing her chore because she knew her parents would take care of it for her. @entity1 used her extra time to play every day after school.  At the end of the week, @entity1 was excited. She had been wanting a new doll that had come out in the stores.  Her friends all had them, and she wanted one, too. But at the end of the week, @entity1 did not get an allowance. Her parents told her it was because she had not done her big chore all week, and had played instead. @entity1 did not get the toy she wanted that week.
