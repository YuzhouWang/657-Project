@entity9 woke up at @entity8. He was very happy because today he got to go to his favorite thing, the fair. @entity9's mother @entity10 was taking him to the fair. After finishing breakfast at @entity6, @entity9 got in the car with his mom. At Ten they got to @entity4's house to pick him up. @entity4 was @entity9's best friend. Then at @entity5, they picked up @entity10's boyfriend @entity0. After driving for one more hour they all finally got to the fair at @entity1. They had all been looking forward to this for a very long time. @entity10 was a bit annoyed by having to drive so much to get here, but she loved her son very much so the trouble was okay. @entity2 had a great time, most of all, @entity9. @entity7's favorite ride was @entity3. @entity0's favorite ride was the Ghoster. It was very scary. @entity9's favorite ride was the same as @entity0's.
