Today is @entity3's first day of school. He is very excited to go to school. He gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom. He brushes his teeth. He also brushes his hair. @entity3 grabs his backpack from the table. He then grabs his pencil and goes to the bus stop. @entity3 sat next to @entity2 on the bus. @entity2 is @entity3's best friend. They have known each other since they were two years old. They got off the bus and got to school. @entity3 was so excited to get to school, he left his pencil on the bus. He had to ask @entity0 for a pencil. @entity0 did not have a pencil so he asked @entity1. She gave him a pencil. He finished his work and the bell rang. His favorite part of school was recess.  He bought a snack at recess then went to play. He had such a good time at recess he did not want the day to end. After school, @entity3 and @entity2 rode the bus home. He said bye to @entity2 and went inside. He was tired after a long day but was ready for school tomorrow.
