@entity2 @entity3 was a ten year old that had many friends in school.  She lived in @entity6 and enjoyed doing gymnastics and playing soccer.  One day, @entity2 came home from school and her parents greeted her.  She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces.  Even @entity0, @entity2's dog, was acting different.  @entity2 asked why everyone was being so strange. @entity2's father, who was known as @entity5, explained to @entity2 that his job was forcing him to move.  @entity2 did not seem to think this was too big of a deal.  Then, @entity2's mother explained that they were moving to @entity7.  @entity7, she explained, was a place in @entity4 and life would be very different there.  As @entity2 began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home, @entity2's mother calmed her with a gentle touch.  @entity0 began howling as @entity2 cried, but was also calmed by @entity2's mother. @entity2 spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes.  She did not know the next time she would be home.  She cried very hard when she said goodbye to her best friend, @entity1. @entity1 did not quite understand where @entity7 was, but promised to visit @entity2. The next day, @entity2 boarded a plane with her family. At first, they thought that @entity0 could not come with them.  However, @entity2 worked hard and helped make sure that he had all of his shots so that he could come. After he had them all, the airport said it was OK for @entity0 to come!  The @entity3 family left and off they went across the ocean to begin their new life in @entity7.
