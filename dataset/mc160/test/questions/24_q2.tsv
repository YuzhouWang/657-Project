Once upon a time @entity0 had a mother who told him that he was good at music.  @entity0 wanted to play music.  He did not know which instrument to play, so he tried a piano first.  The piano went like a sound.  Then he tried a guitar.  The guitar played.  His brother told him that the piano was better to start, so @entity0 played the piano.  He hammered on the keys.  @entity0's brother liked this, but mom did not like this.  @entity0 tried playing very quiet.  @entity0's mom liked this, but @entity0's brother did not like this.  @entity0 tried playing in the middle.  @entity0 liked this, and @entity0's mom liked this, and @entity0's brother liked this.  It was great.
