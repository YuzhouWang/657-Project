I am very hungry. I look for my mother. When is dinner? I ask. @entity0 is at six, my mother says. What can we eat? I ask. We can pick food from our garden, she says. I help her pick corn, beans, and peas. The corn is yellow and white. The beans are small and brown. The peas are green and round. I put the beans in a basket. I put the peas in a bowl. @entity2 brings the corn. We go inside. I have dirty hands. I wash my hands with soap and water. The water is warm. My hands are now clean. @entity2 lets me stir the beans. I fill a pot with water. @entity2 puts the corn into the pot. She puts the pot on the stove. The water boils. @entity1 is my sister. @entity1 puts four plates on the table. Each plate is blue. We each eat two pieces of meat. I eat more corn than @entity1. @entity1 eats more beans than our mother. What did you learn today? @entity1 asks. I can spell ten new words, I say. @entity1 can only spell two words.
