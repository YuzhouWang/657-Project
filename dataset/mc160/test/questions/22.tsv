@entity0 and @entity6 are our neighbors.  @entity0 and @entity6 have an old dog named @entity5.  We love our neighbors.  They are like the perfect grandparents.  We watch @entity5 for them when they go out of town to see their children and grandchildren.  @entity5 is so fun to have around.  He is Fourteen years old.  We have Three other dogs and @entity5 is older than all of them.  They all listen to what @entity5 tells them to do.  It is fun to see them respect him.We are watching @entity5 now.  He is staying with us for Three weeks.  He likes to go for rides in the car.  He likes to go for walks.This time, when @entity0 and @entity6 dropped @entity5 off, @entity0 picked up mom's guitar and played us a song.  He was really good!  Then @entity0 and @entity6 sang a song for us.I can see why @entity5 misses them when they are gone.  They are so nice!  We give @entity5 lots of love so that he is happy at our house when they are on vacation.He likes our dogs and cats.  We have a big black dog named @entity1.  We have a little dog named @entity3 and we have a puppy named @entity2.  We have two cats.  One of our cats is named @entity4.  She has lots of colors.  We also have a white kitten named Vex.One of the best things about watching @entity5 is that we know when @entity0 and @entity6 come home, @entity6 bakes us a cherry pie for taking care of @entity5.  She makes delicious pie.We are very lucky to have such nice neighbors!
