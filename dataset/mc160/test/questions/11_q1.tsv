@entity0 was a princess living in a magical kingdom with her parents and two little brothers. One day a monster bashed down the door to the castle when @entity0 was not home and grabbed her youngest brother. "Give me your jewels or I eat him!" the monster yelled. @entity0's mom and dad called for the guards, but the monster bashed them down. "Give me my jewels!" the monster said. "Or I'll eat your other son too!" @entity0 got home to see the big back of the monster in the door. "What do I do?" @entity0 thought. Then she remembered a move she had seen a fighter use at the fair she had gone to. She also remembered she could lift a thousand pounds. "I know!" She ran up behind the monster, grabbed him around the waist and lifted. She picked the monster up into the air, then slammed him down on his head. He did not move, and @entity0 smiled at her parents. Then she saw their sad faces. Oh no! She had squashed her little brother.
