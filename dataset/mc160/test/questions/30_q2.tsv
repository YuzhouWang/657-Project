@entity0 was in the third grade, and nine years old. Every day he had to walk home from school. There were some kids in his class who were mean to him, and during the winter they would throw snowballs at him. @entity0 could have told the teacher, but one of the kids was a very pretty girl. She was mean, but @entity0 liked her because she was pretty and did not want her to get in trouble.  One day, his teacher asked @entity0 to stay after class to wipe off the chalkboard and to empty the pencil sharpener. By the time he was done, the other kids had gone home. They could no longer throw snowballs at him. @entity0 did not mind helping out his teacher, and he soon stayed after class every day.  @entity0 was not very good at math, and sometimes his teacher would help him when he stayed after school. She said if @entity0 could help her out for at least two weeks, he could pass his math class. @entity0 thought it was a good deal, and ended up being much better at math.
