I am very hungry. I look for my mother.When is dinner? I ask.Dinner is at six, my mother says.What can we eat? I ask.We can pick food from our garden, she says. I help her pick corn, beans, and peas.The corn is yellow and white. The beans are small and brown. The peas are green and round.I put the beans in a basket. I put the peas in a bowl. @entity1 brings the corn. We go inside.I have dirty hands. I wash my hands with soap and water. The water is warm. My hands are now clean.@entity1 lets me stir the beans. I fill a pot with water. @entity1 puts the corn into the pot. She puts the pot on the stove. The water boils.@entity0 is my sister. @entity0 puts four plates on the table.
