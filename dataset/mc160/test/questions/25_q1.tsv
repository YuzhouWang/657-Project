It was very warm for February. @entity8 and her brother, @entity6, played outside in the beautiful, sunny weather. @entity0 was washing his car. When @entity4 came home with the groceries, @entity0 sent the kids to help carry bags. They ran to the garage to help her. But when they got there, @entity4 was kneeling on the ground near where their bikes were parked, petting a gray cat with long hair."Can we pet her?" @entity8 asked."Be careful," @entity4 said. @entity8 knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things."She's fat," @entity6 giggled."She's not fat. She's pregnant," @entity4 told him."What's that mean?" @entity6 asked."It means she's going to have kittens." @entity8 said. "Can we keep her?" @entity8 begged. "Please?"@entity4 and @entity0 looked at each other."We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here," @entity4 said. "Long-haired cats give you rashes.""But you always said you wanted one," @entity0 told @entity4. "Short-haired cats do not bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away. Let's send her over to your parents' farm. She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one."The kids were excited. They named the cat @entity2 because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day. @entity2 had her kittens in April, and, to everyone's excitement, two of them had short hair. @entity0 said that since they were brother and sister, they could keep both kittens. @entity8 named her kitten Lucky, and @entity6 named his kitten Spike. The other two kittens, @entity7 and @entity5, stayed at @entity1 and @entity3's house, but @entity8 and @entity6 each got a kitten of their very own.
