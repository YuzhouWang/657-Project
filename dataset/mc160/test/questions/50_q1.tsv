@entity1 likes to fish.  He uses his new fishing pole.  It is blue and green in color.  He got it for his birthday.  It was his favorite present. He fishes at the pond with his dad.  He fishes at the river with his uncle.  He also sometimes fishes at the lake with his grandpa.  He goes fishing every day he can.  Last Saturday, he caught three catfish at the lake.  His grandpa did not catch any fish that day.  @entity1 did better than him and he was happy.  Someday he wants to go fishing in the ocean.  He hopes someone takes him there.  He dreams about it all the time.  He knows he would catch many huge fish in the ocean.  He ca not wait until he is older.  This way he can go fishing anytime he wants to.  He wants to buy his own fishing boat. He wants a big yellow boat.  @entity0, @entity1 ca not sleep. He is so excited.  His dad told him he can take him fishing tomorrow.  He thinks about all the fish he is going to catch.
