@entity0 had lots of toys. He had balls, dinosaurs, race cars, and even robots! @entity0 had so many toys he had a room for his toys. There he could play with whatever he wanted, when he wanted, and not even have to pick them back up. @entity0 had all kinds of balls. He had red ones, green ones, blue ones and even a pink one he hid from his sister. His robots were so cool they could change shape, fly, or race. Some even saved the world in his imagination. @entity0 loved his dinosaurs. He had one with big sharp teeth, one with little tiny arms, one with purple spots, and even one that his dad said did not eat anything but plants and vegetables. @entity0's favorite toys were his race cars. That was because when his dad came home from work he always went to the toy room with @entity0 to play with his race cars. @entity0 had so much fun he even lets his sister in his toy room so she can play dad too! The toy room was @entity0's favorite room in the house. He spends all the time he can in his room with all his friends and family and he has so much fun.
