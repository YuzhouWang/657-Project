The day was sunny and warm.  The birds were chirping and dancing around happily.  @entity0, the daughter of the dressmaker in town, was walking and whistling and enjoying the day, carrying her fishing pole.  She was on her way to the creek to meet her friend @entity1 to go fishing.  She was so excited; she loved to fish!  As she was walking she took a time out to smell the flowers. She chose to pick some for her mother.  "Mom may be so happy." she said out loud.  "Pleased with what?" she heard behind her.  @entity0 jumped, dropping the flowers.  "Oh @entity1!  Why did you do that?" she asked.  "I'm sorry, I scared you" @entity1 stated.  "I did not mean to, I was curious that's all."  @entity0 turned to @entity1 "That's alright, I was picking flowers for my mom, let's go fishing before it's too late".  @entity0 and @entity1 skipped off to the creek and had a wonderful time fishing. Even if they did not catch anything.
