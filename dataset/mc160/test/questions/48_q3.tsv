When @entity0 woke up that morning, she had no idea where her day was going to take her. She rolled out of bed, turned off her alarm and stretched. She was not feeling like herself that morning, but she was not sure why. @entity0 thought to herself, "I slept well, I ate good food yesterday, and yet I still felt strange". @entity0 stepped into the shower feeling so tired. As she toweled herself off and got dressed, she felt like she was moving very slowly. She went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of orange juice, got a bowl out of the cabinet and filled it with cereal. As @entity0 sat at the table to eat her breakfast, she remembered why she was not feeling like herself. She remembered that she did not exercise the day before. She had spent much of the day sitting in front of her television and playing games. @entity0 knew that on days that she did not exercise, she always felt bad the next day. @entity0 thought for a second, and then looked at the clock. She had time to do some jumping jacks and run outside around her house before she had to leave for the day. She put on her running shoes and went out the front door. After only a quick bit of exercise, @entity0 was feeling much better. She promised herself that she would never forget to exercise again.
