A little girl named @entity1 and her brother @entity2 got a puppy for Christmas.  Their mom knew they had wanted one for some time.  Their mom told them they had to take care of the dog.  They named the dog @entity0 and went out and bought their new puppy bowls, leashes, a dog house, and food.  They were so excited to finally have a dog of their own.  Every day they would make sure they fed @entity0 and took really good care of her.  @entity1 really like brushing her hair and @entity2 really liked walking her.  They loved their puppy.  One day their puppy got out and ran away.  They looked for @entity0 all day.   They were so sad.  They felt as if they did not take good care of their new puppy and that is why their puppy left.  Their mom told them that it would be okay and that they would put lost signs out for the puppy.  @entity2 and @entity1 got crayons. @entity1 colored a picture of their new puppy. @entity2 then put their number on the sign.  They then went down the block and hung pictures on poles and after getting all the signs out, they went home to wait to see if someone would call.  It did not take long.  They had a call that the puppy was found.  It was their neighbor Henry.  The puppy had followed him in as he was walking to his house.  He had never seen the puppy before and knew it must be lost.  @entity1 and @entity2 were so happy to have their puppy back.  They went in the house, fed the puppy, and laid down to watch a movie.  When their mom walked in to tell them to go to bed, they were both snuggled with the puppy, sound asleep.
