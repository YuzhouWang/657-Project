@entity3 really likes school. She does well in school and gets good grades. @entity3's favorite class time activities are reading, math, and writing. She also enjoys playing with her friends at recess. @entity3 has a lot of friends in her class. @entity3's favorite books to read are mysteries. She has read several @entity2 books which are about a young woman who solves exciting mysteries. @entity3 also likes to read comic books. She tries not to read comic books in class because they often make her laugh out loud. Laughing very loud during quiet reading time could get her into trouble! When playing at recess, @entity3 likes to make up new games to play. She and her friend @entity1 enjoy playing games like tag, where you run around chasing after each other. Their games are different than tag because when you tag the other player you call out a math question they have to answer to become "It". @entity3 always tries to play active games; it makes recess much more fun for her. Sometimes, if the balls are out, she plays soccer with some of her friends. @entity0 always makes her very tired. @entity3 really enjoys playing during recess as it helps her to be ready to work hard in class.
