Today is @entity0's birthday, so he invited all of his friends over for his party. @entity0 wanted it to be the best party ever, so he helped his mom plan it so it would be fun. They first picked that it would be a pool party, since they had a huge pool in their backyard. So they told everybody to wear their bathing suits. They went to the sports store and got a basketball hoop that they could put in the pool, so people could play water basketball. Then they went to the food store and picked out all of @entity0's favorite foods. They got chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs so they could cook everything on the grill. When it came time for the party, @entity0's best friend @entity1 was the first to get there. Soon, all of @entity0's friends were there and everybody had a great time. The weather was perfect and the food was delicious. It was the best seventh birthday ever!
