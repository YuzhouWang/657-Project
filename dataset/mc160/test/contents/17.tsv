I ask.\newline\newlineDinner is at six, my mother says.\newline\newlineWhat can we eat? I ask.\newline\newlineWe can pick food from our garden, she says. I help her pick corn, beans, and peas.\newline\newlineThe corn is yellow and white. The beans are small and brown. The peas are green and round.\newline\newlineI put the beans in a basket. I put the peas in a bowl. Mother brings the corn. We go inside.\newline\newlineI have dirty hands. I wash my hands with soap and water. The water is warm. My hands are now clean.\newline\newlineMother lets me stir the beans. I fill a pot with water. Mother puts the corn into the pot. She puts the pot on the stove. The water boils.\newline\newlineMary is my sister. Mary puts four plates on the table. Each plate is blue.\newline\newlineWe each eat two pieces of meat. I eat more corn than Mary. Mary eats more beans than our mother.\newline\newlineWhat did you learn today? Mary asks.\newline\newlineI can spell ten new words, I say.\newline\newlineMary can only spell two words.	one: What color are our plates?	red	white	blue	green	multiple: Which food was not eaten at dinner?	meat	peas	salad	corn	multiple: In which way did I not help my mother?	pick corn	fill a pot with water	wash dishes	put peas in a bowl	one: How many words can Mary spell?	one	four	zero	two
