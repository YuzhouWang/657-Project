@entity0 liked to play games and play sports but more than anything he liked to collect things. He collected bottle caps. He collected sea shells. He collected baseball cards. He has collected baseball cards the longest. He likes to collect the thing that he has collected the longest the most. He once thought about collecting stamps but never did. His most expensive collection was not his favorite collection. @entity0 spent the most money on his bottle cap collection.
