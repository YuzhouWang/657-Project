The other day @entity3 went to the store to buy his mother a big turkey. Inside the storethere was food all over! @entity3 could not believe his own little eyes. From the first @entity4 woke up this morning he knew that he'd be a big man someday, and getting a bigturkey for his mother was the way in which he could show that he is a big man. The storehad all kinds of food from chocolate bars to yummy radish. @entity3 ran for the turkeysection of the store with much force. "Turkeys are good, yummy yummy in my tummy, I wantto eat a big old turkey and then go to the bathroom several times!" @entity3 would cry out tostrangers he met in the turkey section of the store. Then, four and a half seconds later,@entity3 turned into a giant @entity2 named @entity0! No one knew how this could have happened, butthe @entity2 knew. A few years later, @entity3 the now giant @entity2 named @entity0 joined the circusand became a rich man with green in his heart. He could not think of anything elsebut making more money at his circus. One day @entity0 the giant @entity2, also known as @entity3 thehappy boy, remembered that his mother still wanted a big turkey for her late nightbreakfast. Now that @entity0 was a giant walrus making money hand over fist, he could buy hismommy a big old turkey for their night time breakfast. @entity0 the walrus also remembered thathe had earlier built a time machine. @entity0 the giant walrus used his time machine to go backin time to buy his mother who was now a dog named @entity1. @entity0's mother, @entity1 loved thebig turkey, but there was a small problem. @entity1 the dog did not have any teeth!
