There was once a land named @entity5 where cats ran things. @entity4 walked and talked much as you do except they walked on four legs. There were cat policemen, cat firemen, cat teachers, and even a cat bus driver. Most of the cats were very busy.     The King of @entity5 was a small cat named @entity3. He had two brothers named @entity2 and @entity1 who helped him rule in @entity5. @entity2 was head of the @entity6, @entity0 and @entity7 center and @entity1's job was to blow things up. Together the three of them made sure all the cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in the distance.      One day @entity2's wife brought the kittens to see @entity2 at his office. There were white kittens and lots of black and white spotted kittens walking around in the @entity6, @entity0 and @entity7 center.     Well that is all the time we have for now. I hope this short story of the @entity4 of @entity5 made at least one person in the room smile.
