@entity0 was a nice old man who lived by himself. Every day he would walk down the road by his house and say hello to everyone. It was fun saying hello to everyone but he felt lonely sometimes. He wanted a pet to take care of. One day as he was walking down the road a little brown and spotted puppy came up to him and wanted @entity0 to pet him. @entity0 reached down and petted the puppy and smiled. @entity0 hoped to see the puppy again. Many days later @entity0 went for a walk again. He thought to himself, "I guess I will not ever see the brown puppy again. I hoped to see him again." A nice young lady said to @entity0, "Would you like a puppy?" @entity0 said, "I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before." The lady smiled. She was holding the little brown and spotted puppy. She told @entity0 that she found the little puppy in the woods. She said that the little puppy did not have a family. @entity0 said happily, "I would love to give the puppy a home!" So @entity0 grabbed the little brown and spotted puppy and took him home. @entity0 and the little brown puppy became great friends. @entity0 named him Spotty.
