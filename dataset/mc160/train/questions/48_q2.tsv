@entity0 was a nice old man who lived by himself. Every day he would walk down the road byhis house and say hello to everyone. It was fun saying hello to everyone but he feltlonely sometimes. He wanted a pet to take care of. One day as he was walking down the roada little brown and spotted puppy came up to him and wanted @entity0 to pet him. @entity0 reacheddown and petted the puppy and smiled. @entity0 hoped to see the puppy again. Many days later@entity0 went for a walk again. He thought to himself, "I guess I wo not ever see the brownpuppy again. I hoped to see him again." A nice young lady said to @entity0, "Would you like apuppy?" @entity0 said, "I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before." @entity1 smiled. She was holding the little brown and spotted puppy. She told @entity0 that shefound the little puppy in the woods. She said that the little puppy did not have afamily. @entity0 said happily, "I would love to give the puppy a home!" So @entity0 grabbed thelittle brown and spotted puppy and took him home. @entity0 and the little brown puppy becamegreat friends. @entity0 named him Spotty.
