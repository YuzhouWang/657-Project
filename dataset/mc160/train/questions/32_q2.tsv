@entity3 and @entity2 were playing at recess. They were having a great time until @entity3 brought up @entity1's birthday party. @entity3 had been invited to it, but @entity2 had not. This hurt @entity2's feelings a lot. The girls kept on playing and @entity2 was trying to have fun, but all she felt like doing was crying. She could not believe that she had not been invited to @entity1's birthday party. She thought that they were friends and if her best friend @entity3 had been invited, why not her? After recess was over, the class walked back into the school. @entity2 saw @entity1 in line and tried to smile, but it was hard. @entity3 felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to. @entity2 found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over why @entity1 did not invite her to the party. @entity0 @entity2 do something to make @entity1 mad or to hurt her? She could not understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. @entity2 thought she saw @entity1 looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly @entity2 felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to @entity1's party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She immediately started to smile. She smiled at @entity1 and at @entity3. @entity3 gave her a puzzled look because she thought that @entity2 was sad.  At lunch @entity2 explained everything to @entity3. Then @entity2, @entity1, and @entity3 all went off to play.
