@entity4 was a box turtle.  @entity1 found her one day on the side of the road, hiding inher old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.  @entity1 picked @entity4 up to helpher cross the street, because @entity1 knew that turtles are very slow and cars are veryfast.  After @entity1 got @entity4 to the other side of the road, @entity4 peeked her headout of her shell and looked at the little girl.  @entity1 saw that not only was @entity4'sshell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  @entity1 thought @entity4 needed more help from her, so@entity1 took the turtle home.  @entity1 hid @entity4 in her bathtub, because she was worriedthat her mother would be mad. @entity1 went to look up what turtles like to eat and left@entity4 alone in the bathtub.  @entity1 was still looking up  turtle facts when she heardher mother call out, "@entity1, get in here now!"  @entity1 knew she was in trouble.  But when@entity1 came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  @entity1's mom told her that she hada turtle when she was a little girl.  @entity1 and her mom took @entity4 to an animaldoctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in @entity4'seyes.  @entity1 put the drops in @entity4's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon theturtle's eyes were all better. @entity4's shell was still old and worn looking, like anold shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on @entity2's earrings.@entity1 was glad that she helped @entity4.
