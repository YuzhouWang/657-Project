The other day @entity2 went to the store to buy his mother a big turkey. Inside the store there was food all over! @entity2 could not believe his own little eyes. From the first time @entity2 woke up this morning he knew that he'd be a big man someday, and getting a big turkey for his mother was the way in which he could show that he is a big man. The store had all kinds of food from chocolate bars to yummy radish. @entity2 ran for the turkey section of the store with much force. "Turkeys are good, yummy yummy in my tummy, I want to eat a big old turkey and then go to the bathroom several times!" @entity2 would cry out to strangers he met in the turkey section of the store. Then, four and a half seconds later, @entity2 turned into a giant @entity1 named @entity0! No one knew how this could have happened, but the @entity1 knew. A few years later, @entity2 the now giant @entity1 named @entity0 joined the circus and became a rich man with green in his heart. He could not think of anything else but making more money at his circus. One day @entity0 the giant @entity1, also known as @entity2 the happy boy, remembered that his mother still wanted a big turkey for her late night breakfast. Now that @entity0 was a giant walrus making money hand over fist, he could buy his mommy a big old turkey for their night time breakfast. @entity0 the walrus also remembered that he had earlier built a time machine. @entity0 the giant walrus used his time machine to go back in time to buy his mother who was now a dog named @entity3. @entity0's mother, @entity3 loved the big turkey, but there was a small problem. @entity3 the dog did not have any teeth!
