@entity1 wakes up early this morning. He is so happy. Today @entity0 is taking him to the aquarium. @entity1 wants to see blue fish, red fish, yellow fish, and green fish. He also wants to see really big fish. @entity0 and @entity1 are at the aquarium.  "Look!" @entity1 says. "There's a big red fish!" The fish swims away. A small yellow fish swims up to the glass and looks at @entity1.  "A yellow fish!" says @entity1, "He's tiny." Lots of blue fish swim by behind the yellow fish.  "Look at all of those blue fish!" says @entity1. "They stay together." @entity0 points at a long fish and says "That one is as big as me!"  @entity1 laughs. He still wants to find a green fish. He sees a lot of fish, but none of them are green. "@entity0, I ca not find a green fish. I want to see a green fish."  @entity0 laughs. "Let's go to the next window and look." @entity1 looks through the next window and sees lots of fish, but none of them are green fish. "I still do not see any green fish," says @entity1.  "Look there," @entity0 tells him. @entity1 sees a green sea turtle! It's a lot bigger than a fish. After looking at all the fish, @entity0 and @entity1 go home again.
