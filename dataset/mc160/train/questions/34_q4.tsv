@entity2 and his friends love playing baseball. They play in the park every morning. One summer morning they lost the baseball. @entity2 and his friend @entity3 went to the store. They bought two baseballs. They also bought colas for the other kids. They spent ten dollars. @entity2 and @entity3 went back to the park. His friend @entity0 drank his cola and went to bat. @entity0 hit a home run and rounded the bases. All of @entity2's friends cheered very loudly.  The sun was very bright and @entity2 had an idea. @entity2 and his friends went to the pool in town and swam that afternoon. They met @entity4 and @entity5 at the pool. They also met @entity1 at the pool. The lifeguard made them put their sandals, watches and hats by the fence. @entity2 went home after swimming. He was very tired. He went to sleep but had a lot of fun that day.
