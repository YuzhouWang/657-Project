He wanted a pet to take care of. One day as he was walking down the roada little brown and spotted puppy came up to him and wanted @entity0 to pet him. @entity0 reacheddown and petted the puppy and smiled. @entity0 hoped to see the puppy again. Many days later@entity0 went for a walk again. He thought to himself, "I guess I wo not ever see the brownpuppy again. I hoped to see him again." A nice young lady said to @entity0, "Would you like apuppy?" @entity0 said, "I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before." @entity1 smiled.
