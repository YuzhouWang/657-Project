I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to @entity2.  There,we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I sawmonkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they did not even scare me.  @entity3, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where therewere lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar waterto feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, @entity1 was scared.  I was not sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flyingeverywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They saidbutterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in theroom.Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door!The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at meto stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said @entity0 sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out ofthere!I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not beafraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for mybrother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and findbutterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on meand I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!
