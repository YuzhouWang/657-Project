@entity0 is out for the summer.  @entity1 and @entity5 are playing on a baseball team. They are both nine years old this year.  Their team is called the @entity6.  @entity1 plays first base and @entity5 is a pitcher.  They both love baseball.  They started playing when they were four years old.  It is so fun for them.  Their team has won three games so far.  They beat the Jets, the @entity7, and the @entity3 so far.  They have not lost any games yet.  They are playing the @entity4s today.  The @entity4s have not lost any games either.  The score was one to one until the last inning.  There were two outs.  @entity5 came to the plate.  The pitcher named @entity2 threw the ball hard.  @entity5 swung his bat too late and missed.  He missed the next pitch too.  It was too fast.  He was ready for the next pitch.  He hit it hard to center field.  The @entity4 player in center field jumped to catch it, but it went over his head and over the fence.  It was a home run!  The @entity6 won the game!
