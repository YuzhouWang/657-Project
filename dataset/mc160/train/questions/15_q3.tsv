@entity1 bought a new puppy. He named the new puppy @entity3. @entity3 was a good dog and minded @entity1. @entity1 took @entity3 to the pond behind his house. @entity3 loved playing in the water. @entity1 would throw the frisbee to @entity3. He would also throw a bone to @entity3. @entity3 loved running. @entity2 came to the pond to visit @entity1. @entity2 and @entity0 always played with @entity1. @entity2 was @entity1's best friend. They both loved @entity3 and @entity3 loved them. @entity2 brought lunch to the pond. She also brought colas to the pond. They ate and @entity3 sat by them being a good dog. When they were done eating they packed their lunch up. They put @entity3 on his leash and they went home.
