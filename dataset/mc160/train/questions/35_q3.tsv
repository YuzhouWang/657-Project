Once upon a time, there was a boy named @entity0.   And @entity0 loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.  One day, @entity0 went outside to ride his bike.  On the way out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and @entity0 grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, "Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"  @entity0 thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet. @entity0 and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, @entity0 was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, "What are you, scared?"  @entity0 did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  @entity0 started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes were not working.  @entity0, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital. At the hospital, his mother was there.  @entity0 opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and @entity0 knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She did not have to say it.  In the end, @entity0 learned that it's important to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that are not cool in the first place.
