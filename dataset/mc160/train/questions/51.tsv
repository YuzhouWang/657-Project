Two of her friends were going to thenearby beach to do some swimming and enjoy the sun. @entity0 went with them and when they gotthere the beach was very full and there were people everywhere.  They changed into theirbathing suits and went to the water.  The water was very cold.  They chose not swim andwalked to the sand.  Then they laid down on some towels and enjoyed the sun.After several hours @entity0 and her friends fell asleep.  They woke up and the sun wasbeginning to set.  When @entity0 sat up she found that it was painful to touch her skin.When she looked down she saw that she had a very bad sunburn.  Her friends were also verybadly sunburned so they went home.  @entity0's mother gave her a cream to put on the sunburn.Afterwards she felt a lot better and went to sleep.
