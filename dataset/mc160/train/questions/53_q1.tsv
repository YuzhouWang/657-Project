One day @entity0 and @entity2 went to the neighborhood fair. They were so exited because thisyear @entity1 the clown was going to be there. They had heard a lot about @entity1 the clown, he wasfunny and knew a lot of balloon tricks. He always made the kids laugh and gave out smallprizes to many of the children at the fair. @entity0 and @entity2 had even heard that sometimes@entity1 the clown would give out free cotton candy and candy apples. They had waited all yearand were so excited. They did all their chores and cleaned their rooms so they could go tothe fair. When they got to the fair they were so happy to see that @entity1 the clown washanding out cotton candy and candy apples. @entity0 and @entity2 waited in line and then once itwas their turn @entity0 got a balloon in the shape of a dog and @entity2 got a big bag of cottoncandy.
