Once upon a time there were three rabbits, named @entity0, @entity2, and @entity4. @entity2was a brown rabbit with large eyes. @entity4 was grey and white and had messy fur. @entity0was black and very fat. They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat. Every day theywould leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow ofgrass. They loved to eat that grass. One day, @entity2 thought he smelled somethinginteresting. At first he thought it might be dirt. Then he thought maybe some sort offlower. So, he asked a nearby squirrel. The squirrel's name was @entity3. @entity3 said that hethought it was mushrooms. However, @entity4, the smartest rabbit, went to go look, and helearned that it was actually a garden of carrots. The rabbits were all excited. They allloved carrots! They ate all the carrots.
