@entity5 walked out the door with a huge grin on his face. It was his first day of middleschool. His mom, who is a nurse at the high school, waved at him as he entered thebus. The bus driver said "good to see you @entity5". @entity5 said "you too @entity2".  @entity5 was soexcited to see his friends that he could barely breathe. As he walked down the school bus,@entity5's friends @entity3, @entity1, @entity0 and @entity4 all waved to him. Instead of sitting next to hisbest friend @entity4, @entity5 turned left and sat next to @entity3. @entity0 and @entity1 started laughing athim and teased "@entity5 and @entity3 sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G". @entity5's face turned red fromembarrassment.  @entity4 felt bad for @entity5 and reached into his pockets to help hisfriend. When he reached in, he felt a pencil, a rock and a folded up piece ofpaper. @entity4's eyes twinkled. He had a plan. Without @entity1 and @entity0 seeing, @entity4 quicklymade a paper airplane with the piece of paper he found in his pocket. He threw the paperairplane at @entity1. The plane hit @entity1 in the face. Both @entity1 and @entity0 stopped laughing. @entity5looked over to @entity4 and smiled.
