@entity0 is a dog.  @entity0 is a big red dog.  He likes to go to the park.  @entity0 likes the swing. He likes to go as high as he can.  To get to the park, @entity0 has to go to town.  When he is in town, he walks by the school.  It is by the baseball field.  @entity0 likes to go to the park with @entity2.  @entity2 is a small dog.  @entity2 is a brown dog.  @entity2 likes to go down the slide. @entity2 likes to go fast.  @entity0 likes to slide too.  @entity0 and @entity2 like to go down the slide many times.  When it gets dark, @entity0 and @entity2 have to go home.  @entity0 has to go home.  He has to go eat.  Swinging makes @entity0 hungry.  @entity2 has to go home too.  He does not like to be in the dark.  They can go to the park tomorrow.  Goodbye @entity0 and @entity2.
