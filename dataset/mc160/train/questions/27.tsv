There once was a big black and white dog named @entity0. His owner's name was @entity1. @entity1thought he was the best dog in the whole world.One night, when @entity0 and @entity1 were taking a walk in the park, they saw two men walkingdown the path. Both men were dressed in very nice suits.@entity1 waved at the men. "Good evening," he said. "How are you tonight?""Hello," one of the men said. "It is such a great night for walking."@entity1 and @entity0 kept walking down the path. It was a very dark night, but the moon wasshining bright. When @entity1 turned around to look for the two men, he could not see them atall. They were nowhere to be seen.Later that night, when their walk was over, @entity1 and @entity0 were lying on the bed. Theywere watching a television show about ghosts."Do you think maybe those two men were ghosts?" @entity1 said out loud. "They did not leave atrace."@entity0 was a dog, but he acted like he understood. He barked.@entity1 smiled. He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did.
