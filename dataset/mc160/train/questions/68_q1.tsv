@entity1 thought about things that he liked to do.Well, for one, he liked baseball. Compared to his friends, he was very good at thesport. He did not even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ballso hard that it flew out of the park. @entity0 run!He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazytricks like slam dunking (but he did not really like all of the passes). He was not quitethat good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knewthat if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he did not play footballhimself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands,cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak atall for the rest of the day.
