Once upon a time there was a man who needed to write story. His name was @entity3. He had a bad case of writer's block. After a bit, he wrote a story about writing a story. This may seem a bit odd. Well, it was. The important thing to know is that @entity3 wanted money. This was so he could show off for his girl, @entity2. @entity2 had two living parents named @entity0 and @entity1. The exciting thing about @entity3 writing these stories, was that he could write whatever he wanted to. He could have written about bears. Or it could have been his best friend Error. There were so many choices for @entity3. He was very happy. He was happy because he was almost done writing the story. @entity2, had she known about the writing would have been sad that @entity3 spent so much time thinking of odd stories.
