Once upon a time there was a man who needed to write story. His name was @entity3. He had abad case of writer's block. After a bit, he wrote a story about writing a story. This mayseem a bit odd. Well, it was. The important thing to know is that @entity3 wanted money. Thiswas so he could show off for his girl, @entity2. @entity2 had two living parents named @entity0 @entity1. The exciting thing about @entity3 writing these stories, was that he could write whateverhe wanted to. He could have written about bears. Or it could have been his best friendError. There were so many choices for @entity3. He was very happy. He was happy because he wasalmost done writing the story. @entity2, had she known about the writing would have been sadthat @entity3 spent so much time thinking of odd stories.
