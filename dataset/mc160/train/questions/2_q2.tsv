@entity0 rolled over in bed and looked around the room.  He let out a breath.His eyes were half-closed as he shoved the covers back from his bed, and movedtowards the door.  He knew that he had to check on @entity1, if he did nothing else. She wasill, with a heart problem, and he worried about her all the time.They both lived in a home for orphans, and he had since his parents had died, when he wasthe age of four. He had taken care of @entity1 as if she were his sister ever since. Hewandered to her room sitting himself by her on her bed, shoving her hair from herface.She moved on the bed as he pulled her into his arms, "@entity1." He said into her ear, "It'stime to wake up." He pressed a kiss to her head, and her eyes opened."Hawthy?" She said, her nickname for him moving from her lips."Yea." He moved her hair."I want to go outside today," she said, and he nodded in response."If you are up to it, I wo not stop you", he told her, and she smiled."Thanks Hawthy", she said.It was not long until she fell back to sleep.
