The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from theirschool. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who livedthere were the @entity5 family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, theywould plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where theyended. @entity3 gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. @entity2 family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kepta few cows and horses. @entity0 fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk fromtheir cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. @entity1 kids got to ride on the big brown horses the @entity4 had. They went up into the nearbyhills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were manygoats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The @entity5 children liked to playwith their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did withtheir dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads andtiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. Theywere a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought backstories for all the rest of the school to hear.
