There was once a land named @entity6 where cats ran things. @entity5 walked and talked muchas you do except they walked on four legs. There were cat policemen, cat firemen, catteachers, and even a cat bus driver. Most of the cats were very busy.   The King of @entity6 was a small cat named @entity4. He had two brothers named @entity2 and@entity1 who helped him rule in @entity6. @entity2 was head of the @entity7, @entity0 and Creamcenter and @entity1's job was to blow things up. Together the three of them made sure allthe cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in thedistance.    One day @entity2's wife brought the kittens to see @entity2 at his office. There were whitekittens and lots of black and white spotted kittens walking around in the @entity7, @entity0 @entity3 center.   Well that is all the time we have for now. I hope this short story of the @entity5 of@entity6 made at least one person in the room smile.
