@entity3 had to fix some things around the house. He had to fix the door. He had to fix thewindow. But before he did anything he had to fix the toilet. @entity3 called over his bestfriend @entity2 to help him. @entity2 brought with him his friends Molly and @entity0. @entity3 thought @entity1 was going to bring Dolly with him but he did not. The four of them got to work rightaway. Fixing the toilet was easy. Fixing the door was also easy but fixing the window wasvery hard. The window was stuck and could not be opened. They all pushed on the windowreally hard until finally it opened. Once the window was fixed the four of them made adelicious dinner and talked about all of the good work that they had done. @entity3 was gladthat he had such good friends to help him with his work.
