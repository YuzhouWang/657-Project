@entity0 had a pet turtle that he took good care of, everyday.  His turtle's name was @entity1.  @entity1 liked to walk around outside in the garden and dig small holes to sleep in.  @entity0 loved @entity1 and would visit him outside when he got home from school. @entity1's favorite food was oatmeal.  So, every day after school, @entity0 would make @entity1 a big bowl of oatmeal and take it outside for @entity1 to enjoy.  @entity1 would see @entity0 and walk up to him as fast as a turtle can go.  @entity0 would put the bowl down and wait for @entity1 to come up to the bowl to eat from it. When @entity1 reached the bowl, he put his nose on it.  But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat.  @entity0 reached down and blew on the hot oatmeal, to cool it down for @entity1 to eat.  Once the oatmeal was cool enough, @entity1 could dig in and eat his big bowl of oatmeal.  @entity0 loved to watch as @entity1 ate his bowl of oatmeal, because @entity0 took good care of @entity1, everyday.
