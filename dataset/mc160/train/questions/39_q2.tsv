@entity3's birthday is next week.  He is hoping for a very special gift.  What are some things @entity3 is hoping for? He would like a big, bouncy ball, like his friends @entity2 and @entity4 have.  One with blue stripes! He would really like some new sneakers.  @entity1, @entity3's best friend, got a special pair of sneakers for HIS birthday last month.  They have pictures of robots on them and even light up when you walk! He would really, @entity5 like a shiny new bicycle.  @entity3 has an old bicycle now. He is getting too big for it.  He saw a red one in the store yesterday when he was shopping with his Mom.  It looked like it was the right size for him! But what @entity3 wants most of all is a new baby brother.  Today his Mom and @entity0 said that he might have one very, very soon.  Then @entity3 and his little brother can have many fun birthdays together.  That would be the best gift of all!
