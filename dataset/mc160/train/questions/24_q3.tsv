@entity2 was a box turtle.  @entity0 found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in her old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.  @entity0 picked @entity2 up to help her cross the street, because @entity0 knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.  After @entity0 got @entity2 to the other side of the road, @entity2 peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.  @entity0 saw that not only was @entity2's shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  @entity0 thought @entity2 needed more help from her, so @entity0 took the turtle home.  @entity0 hid @entity2 in her bathtub, because she was worried that her mother would be mad. @entity0 went to look up what turtles like to eat and left @entity2 alone in the bathtub.  @entity0 was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard her mother call out, "@entity0, get in here now!"  @entity0 knew she was in trouble.  But when @entity0 came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  @entity0's mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.  @entity0 and her mom took @entity2 to an animal doctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in @entity2's eyes.  @entity0 put the drops in @entity2's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the turtle's eyes were all better. @entity2's shell was still old and worn looking, like an old shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on @entity1's earrings. @entity0 was glad that she helped @entity2.
