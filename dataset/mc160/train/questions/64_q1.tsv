A day at the beach.  When @entity3 woke in the morning, he was super excited!  Today was the day!  It was Sunday, the day that @entity3's mom and dad had promised to take @entity3 to the beach. @entity3's grandma had given a pail and shovel to @entity3 to use in the sand.  At breakfast @entity3 was so excited he was wiggling in his seat!  @entity2 told @entity3 that they would leave when the big hand on the clock was pointing to the @entity1, and the little had was pointing to the @entity4.  @entity2 asked @entity3 if he would like to help make sandwiches for the trip, and @entity3 said that he wanted to help.  @entity0 said, "let's make a game of it, we need to make a sandwich for each of us.  There are three of us, so we need three sandwiches.  Let's count as we make the sandwiches!"  @entity3 counted as mom made the sandwiches, one for dad, one for mom and one for @entity3.  Then mom started to make another sandwich!  "@entity2!" said @entity3, "we have three sandwiches and that makes one sandwich for each of us."  @entity3's mom laughed, "You're right @entity3!"  @entity3's mom said she was being silly.
