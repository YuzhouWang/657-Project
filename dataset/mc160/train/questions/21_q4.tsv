@entity0 wanted to go to the park and play because she wanted to see her friends. When she got to the park @entity0 did not see anyone. After looking, she saw her friend @entity1 by the basketball hoop. @entity1 was playing all by himself. @entity1 was happy when he saw @entity0. @entity0 and @entity1 played basketball they saw the ice cream man driving in his truck. @entity1 asked @entity0 if she wanted him to buy her an ice cream cone. @entity0 said she would like him to do that. @entity0 sat on the bench as @entity1 walked to the ice cream truck. @entity0 looked in the sky and saw a pretty bird flying in a large circle. The bird flew away. @entity1 came back with two ice cream cones. One of the ice cream cones had rainbow sprinkles on it. @entity1 gave the ice cream cone with sprinkles to @entity0. @entity1 and @entity0 sat on the bench and watched a group of boys play football as they ate their ice cream cones. One of the boys broke his leg. When @entity1 and @entity0 were finished with their ice cream, @entity0 ran home before the street lights came on.
