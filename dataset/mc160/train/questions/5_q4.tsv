One sunny day, @entity1 went on a walk through the park. While walking, she noticedsomething strange. No one was outside. She was the only person at the park. "How strange,where is everyone?" she thought. @entity1 looked everywhere. She looked inside therestrooms, under the benches, and even at the top of the slide. She was confused. Usually,she would see her friends playing with each other. She started walking again when one ofher friends popped up, surprising her. Her friend asked her, "Why are you outside?" @entity1asked what she meant, and explained that she always came out to the park to play. @entity0 then looked at her strangely and asked, "Did not @entity2 invite you to his party?"@entity1 had not known that @entity2 was holding a party. She was sad that he had not invitedher. She walked back home, upset.
