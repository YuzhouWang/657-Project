Then they were also going to have a picniclunch on the beach. After their picnic lunch, @entity3's mom was going to light a campfire andthey were going to eat toasted marshmallows.@entity3 and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters wereboth very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only Four years old. Because they livedin the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, @entity3 played @entity4 with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with @entity1, theyplayed @entity0. @entity3 would think of something, and his mother would ask him questionsto try and guess what it was.When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waveslapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on @entity3's toes, and hislittle sisters giggled when the waves hit them.When they had had their fill of swimming, @entity3's mom had them sit down to a nicedinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. @entity6 had lemon pie for dessert.@entity3's mom started a fire, and they spent the rest of the evening as the sun set eatingtoasted marshmallows and singing campfire songs. @entity3 thought it was a very good day.
