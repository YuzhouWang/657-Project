@entity4 Goes To The @entity5 Today was exciting. @entity4's mom was taking him and his little sisters, @entity3 and @entity2, to the beach! They were going to go swimming. Then they were also going to have a picnic lunch on the beach. After their picnic lunch, @entity4's mom was going to light a campfire and they were going to eat toasted marshmallows. @entity4 and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters were both very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only Four years old. Because they lived in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, @entity4 played @entity1 with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with @entity1, they played @entity0. @entity4 would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions to try and guess what it was. When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waves lapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on @entity4's toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them. When they had had their fill of swimming, @entity4's mom had them sit down to a nice dinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. They also had lemon pie for dessert. @entity4's mom started a fire, and they spent the rest of the evening as the sun set eating toasted marshmallows and singing campfire songs. @entity4 thought it was a very good day.
