@entity0 and her friend @entity1 were bored one Saturday.  It was a hot summer day.  They did notwant to stay inside any longer but they did not know what to do.  They were tired ofwatching TV inside.  Suddenly, @entity1 had an idea.  She said, "@entity0, we could make somemoney."  "How?," asked @entity0.  "Well, it is hot outside," said @entity1. "People are thirstyout there.  We could make money by making some lemonade and iced tea and have people payfor it."  "That is a great idea," answered @entity0, "let's do it!" @entity1 had made some icedtea with her mom earlier that day.  She asked her mom permission to use it.  Her mom saidyes.  She and @entity1 made two pitchers of lemonade.  They got a cooler full of ice and madea sign so people knew what was for sale.  @entity1's mom helped them get a table and chairsand set up out on the corner in their neighborhood.  It was so hot out that people who sawtheir stand came to buy drinks right away. Their first visitors to their stand were theirfriends, @entity3 and @entity2.  In a half hour, they had to close their stand. They were allout of lemonade and iced tea.  They had made a lot of money. They split the money and eachgot ten dollars.  It was a great day.
