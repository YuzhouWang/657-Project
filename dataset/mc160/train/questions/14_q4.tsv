His name was @entity0. @entity0 had a nice dad @entity1. @entity0 and @entity5 had been friends for almost a year. @entity5 and @entity0 loved to play inthe big back yard. Sometimes, @entity0 would ask his friend @entity2 to come to the back yardand play with them. @entity2 would always bring his puppy too. @entity2's puppy was named@entity4. @entity0 and  @entity2 would run around the back yard and @entity5 and @entity4 chased them andbarked. They all had so much fun playing together. One day, @entity0 told @entity5 that tomorrowwould be a very special day. It would be @entity5's birthday. @entity5 was very excited. The nextday came and @entity0 threw a birthday party for @entity5. All of @entity5's friends were there andthey had presents for him. @entity2 brought @entity5 a new ball and @entity4 brought him abone. There was one more present for @entity5 to open.
