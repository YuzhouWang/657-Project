In a far away land known as @entity4, there was a great man named @entity1. This was a very odd land because the only thing to do was play chess. @entity1 did not very much care for chess as he was very bored with it. Another problem @entity1 had was that he did not like some of the other people in this land. They had names like @entity5, @entity3, @entity0, and @entity2. And most of all, there was King. He was the greatest person in @entity4. One day, during their normal battle, @entity1 saw an opening to move to the far end of @entity4. He almost got hurt by @entity2 but he got away. Amazingly, when he got to the other end he became as powerful as @entity3. With this amazing power, @entity1 chose to help keep King safe. All was well until @entity1 woke up and knew that it was only a dream. He was still @entity1.
