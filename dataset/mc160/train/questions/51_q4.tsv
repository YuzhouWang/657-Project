Two of her friends were going to thenearby beach to do some swimming and enjoy the sun. @entity0 went with them and when they gotthere the beach was very full and there were people everywhere.  They changed into theirbathing suits and went to the water.  The water was very cold.  They chose not swim andwalked to the sand.  Then they laid down on some towels and enjoyed the sun.After several hours @entity0 and her friends fell asleep.  They woke up and the sun wasbeginning to set.
