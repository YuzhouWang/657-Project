@entity0 was a Thirteen year old girl with blond hair and blue eyes.  She had gotten out of her last day of school and was free for the summer.  Two of her friends were going to the nearby beach to do some swimming and enjoy the sun. @entity0 went with them and when they got there the beach was very full and there were people everywhere.  They changed into their bathing suits and went to the water.  The water was very cold.  They chose not swim and walked to the sand.  Then they laid down on some towels and enjoyed the sun. After several hours @entity0 and her friends fell asleep.  They woke up and the sun was beginning to set.  When @entity0 sat up she found that it was painful to touch her skin. When she looked down she saw that she had a very bad sunburn.  Her friends were also very badly sunburned so they went home.  @entity0's mother gave her a cream to put on the sunburn. Afterwards she felt a lot better and went to sleep.
