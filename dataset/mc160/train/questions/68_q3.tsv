@entity1 thought about things that he liked to do. Well, for one, he liked baseball. Compared to his friends, he was very good at the sport. He did not even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ball so hard that it flew out of the park. @entity0 run! He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking (but he did not really like all of the passes). He was not quite that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday. Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he did not play football himself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands, cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at all for the rest of the day.
