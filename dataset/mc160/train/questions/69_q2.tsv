@entity2 loved walking through the woods with her dog, @entity0.  @entity0 and @entity2 would go on allsorts of adventures together.  They really loved looking for blueberries together and thenfalling asleep next to each other in the tall grass.  One day, as @entity2 was picking theblueberries, she turned around to find that @entity0 was not there.  She became worried and ranoff to look for her dog.  She looked in all of their favorite spots...next to the stream, in their secret hiding placebehind the raspberry bushes, and even inside the old cabin that sat in the woods.  Butpoor @entity0 was nowhere to be found.  Nonetheless, @entity2 would not give up.   She kept lookingand she found him not very far away.  He had seen a squirrel and run to chase it.  When@entity2 called @entity0's name he left the squirrel and happily returned to @entity2, wagging his tailas he went.
