@entity1 loved walking through the woods with her dog, @entity0.  @entity0 and @entity1 would go on all sorts of adventures together.  They really loved looking for blueberries together and then falling asleep next to each other in the tall grass.  One day, as @entity1 was picking the blueberries, she turned around to find that @entity0 was not there.  She became worried and ran off to look for her dog.   She looked in all of their favorite spots...next to the stream, in their secret hiding place behind the raspberry bushes, and even inside the old cabin that sat in the woods.  But poor @entity0 was nowhere to be found.  Nonetheless, @entity1 would not give up.   She kept looking and she found him not very far away.  He had seen a squirrel and run to chase it.  When @entity1 called @entity0's name he left the squirrel and happily returned to @entity1, wagging his tail as he went.
