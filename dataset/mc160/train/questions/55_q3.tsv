She put some corn out for the squirrel to eat, but otherbully squirrels came, too. The brown-haired lady started giving the little squirrelpeanuts to eat. She gave some to the bully squirrels, too, so they would leave thethree-legged squirrel alone.The winter snow melted and then it was spring. The grass turned green and the air waswarm. Now, when the little squirrel with three legs would come to see the brown-hairedlady with the peanuts, it would take the peanuts and dig a little hole and hide thepeanuts for later.
