@entity2 got a @entity1 for his birthday present. He had never had any pets before, butwas always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthdaywas in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named@entity0. @entity0 and @entity2 would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to gothrough the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never wentnear the lake because @entity2 was afraid of water. One day, @entity0 hid a little too well and@entity2 could not find him. @entity2 spent the afternoon looking for his @entity1 wherethey often played, like the field and forest. @entity2 was a shy boy who often read byhimself, and @entity0 was his best friend.  After dinner, he went to look for @entity0 one last timebefore he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, sohe ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw @entity0 playing with a poodle. The dogswere having so much fun. @entity2 brought @entity0 home, happy that he had his puppy back. @entity0seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summerlong, @entity2 took @entity0 to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry aboutlosing his present.
