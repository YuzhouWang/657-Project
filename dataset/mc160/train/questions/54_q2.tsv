@entity1 is a young child who eats potatoes. He normally wakes up around Seven in the morning. He has a dog named @entity4. @entity4 is a very smart dog. @entity1 also owns a farm. He grows potatoes on it. One day he went out with his dog to go check on the farm. There they found a wild duck, a cat, and a pumpkin. @entity4 started to chase the duck. The duck flew away. @entity4 started to get hungry. @entity4 then ate the pumpkin. @entity1 got mad at @entity4 for eating the pumpkin. @entity1 then threw @entity4 into the house. @entity1 then grabbed a bucket. He started to collect as many potatoes as he could find. @entity1 loved potatoes. He collected around @entity2 @entity0 potatoes! @entity1 started to run out of room for all the potatoes he found. He then started to eat as many as he could. In One hour he ate @entity3 potatoes! He got so full he took a nap. When he awoke he found the cat eating all the potatoes! The cat ate Two @entity0 potatoes before @entity1 awoke. However, @entity1 was too full and fat to move. The cat laughed and wanted to eat the potatoes again. Just then, @entity4 comes running out to chase the cat away! The cat was too fat to run away. It had eaten too many potatoes! @entity4 grabbed the cat with his teeth and tossed the cat down a well. @entity4 became a hero for saving the potatoes! @entity1 now lets @entity4 eat whatever he wants, including pumpkins! @entity4 is a very happy dog now!
