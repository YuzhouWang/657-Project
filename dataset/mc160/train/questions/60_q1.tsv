@entity3 takes his dog for a walk. @entity3 has many pets. He has a turtle named @entity5. He has a cat named @entity4. He has a bird named squeaky. The dog is named @entity0. @entity0 loves to go on walks with @entity3. @entity0 jumps around in front of the doorway.  @entity3 puts on his hat, coat, and gloves because it is chilly outside. @entity3 puts a leash around @entity0's neck. @entity3 opens the door and they are ready to go. @entity3 walks up @entity1 to the stop sign. The stop sign is red. @entity3 looks both ways and then walks across @entity2 street with @entity0. @entity3 and @entity0 walk up the hill.  At the top of the hill, @entity3 and @entity0 turn left. They walk downhill on First Street. At the bottom of the hill, they see a small pond. The pond is on @entity6. @entity0 is very happy. Swimming in the pond are ducks. There are white ducks and brown ducks. There are baby ducks, too. @entity0 walks all around the pond. @entity3 watches the ducks as they swim around the pond. When it is time to go, @entity3 leads @entity0 back to the sidewalk. It is warmer and @entity3 takes off his hat and coat. They walk home.
