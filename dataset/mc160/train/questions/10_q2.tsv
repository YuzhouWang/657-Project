@entity0 wanted to eat an orange.  He liked fruit, and the only fruits in the house wereapples, which he did not like, oranges, and strawberries, which made him itchy.  But hismother had put oranges on top of the refrigerator.   @entity0 could not reach the top of therefrigerator.  He got the stool that he used to reach things in the cupboards.   But thestool was not tall enough on its own.  He thought if he stood on the edge of the kitchensink he could reach the oranges.  (The kitchen sink was right next to the refrigerator).So he used the stool to get up to the edge of the sink, and then he stood on the edge ofthe sink to get the oranges.  He took one out of the bag and then put the bag back on topof the refrigerator.  Then he used the stool to climb back down again with his orange.  @entity1 at the kitchen table, peeled the orange, and ate it.  Then he took all of the piecesof orange peel and threw them away in the yard waste.
