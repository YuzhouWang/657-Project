The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river andfished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in thebackyard, reading. "Hey, you look like you need some fun," he said.  "Want to go fishing?"I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and somefishing line. @entity1 was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  Iasked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and thestore, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend @entity0. They used tocatch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  @entity2 got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned andwalked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees rightat the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then wesat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about whathe and @entity0 did as kids. We did not have any worms, so we never caught any fish, butsitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.
