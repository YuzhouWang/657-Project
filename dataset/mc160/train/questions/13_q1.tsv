Flying a kite can be dangerous. When I was eight years old I went to the park with my dadto fly my new kite. We stood on the top of a hill and tried to catch the wind. It took usalmost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air. As it lifted into the sky,the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite. @entity1 higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground. @entity0 was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller. I flew all theway out of the city and over the lake. Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fellcloser to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I couldland on their boat. I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, wheremy dad picked me up. He took me out for ice cream and we went home.
