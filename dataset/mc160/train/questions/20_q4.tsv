There once was a woman named @entity2. @entity2's best friend was a dog named @entity3. @entity2 and @entity3 went everywhere together. They had a lot in common. They both liked to play games like fetch and hide and seek. Neither of them liked to take a bath. @entity2 and @entity3 enjoyed smelling flowers and eating hamburgers. But they also were very different from one another. For one thing, @entity3 was a dog! @entity3 liked talking to strangers and visiting new places. But @entity2 was shy. One day a man named @entity0 came by. @entity2 hid behind a tree when she saw him. @entity3 tried to tell her it was okay, but she was too scared to listen. So @entity3 went out to say hello to @entity0. @entity0 was very nice and he liked the same games as @entity3. @entity2 watched @entity3 chase after a ball @entity0 threw. She could tell @entity0 was a nice man. She wanted to play too. @entity3 saw her watching and led his new friend over to @entity2. @entity0 waved to @entity2 and brought her a flower. @entity2 smiled at him. She thought he was very kind and she was not as nervous as before. @entity3 barked happily. @entity1 for new friends!
