There once was a woman named @entity5. @entity5's best friend was a dog named @entity2. @entity5 and@entity2 went everywhere together. They had a lot in common. They both liked to play gameslike fetch and hide and seek. Neither of them liked to take a bath. @entity5 and @entity2 enjoyedsmelling flowers and eating hamburgers. But they also were very different from oneanother. For one thing, @entity2 was a dog! @entity2 liked talking to strangers and visiting newplaces. But @entity5 was shy. One day a man named @entity4 came by. @entity5 hid behind a tree whenshe saw him. @entity2 tried to tell her it was okay, but she was too scared to listen. @entity0 went out to say hello to @entity4. @entity4 was very nice and he liked the same games as@entity2. @entity5 watched @entity2 chase after a ball @entity4 threw. She could tell @entity4 was a niceman. She wanted to play too. @entity2 saw her watching and led his new friend over @entity3. @entity4 waved to @entity5 and brought her a flower. @entity5 smiled at him. She thought he wasvery kind and she was not as nervous as before. @entity2 barked happily. @entity1 for new friends!
