@entity1's grandmother was studying at a school in @entity3.  She lived at the school year round.  So @entity1's mother put him on a bus to the city and his grandmother picked him up at the @entity0 bus stop.  They took the train back to the school.  They put @entity1's backpack on a rack in the guest room.  Then @entity1 and his grandmother went out for a walk.  They stopped at a corner shop for pizza and sodas.  Then they walked to the @entity2.  At the top of the @entity2 they looked out over the city.  They counted all the bridges and looked at all the tall buildings.  @entity1 bought three postcards and a little snow globe in the shop. Then they took the elevator back to the ground floor.  Next they took a yellow cab to @entity4.  They rode the carousel and went to the zoo.  @entity1's favorite animals were the monkeys.  He did not like the snakes at all.  After they had ice cream cones, @entity1 and his grandmother took the train back to her school.  They had salads for supper.  Then they read a story together. @entity1's grandmother made up her sofa bed for @entity1 as they made plans for the next day. @entity1 wanted to know if they could go to a baseball game.  His grandmother said she would get tickets.
