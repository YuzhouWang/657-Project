As they went to the doors they saw they had the letters A, B, C, and D on them. What did it mean? @entity0, the leader, told everyone to stop and look at the doors, so as to see which door they would go through. The walls were brown and dirty. The lights were yellow. @entity2 A was blue. This was @entity1's choice. @entity2 B was red. @entity2 C was the same color as door A. @entity2 D a color no one had seen before. @entity3 felt that @entity0 needed to make a choice soon before the monsters caught their scent. @entity4 was the first to voice a choice. He wanted to go in the red door. @entity0 told him that the old books said to go in the blue door. This is why it was so hard for @entity0 right now. Two doors were blue. Being a good leader, @entity0 asked everyone what they wanted to do. The final choice was door D. They went in and enjoyed all of time in a world with odd colors.
