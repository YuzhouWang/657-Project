@entity2 wants to play @entity0. She goes to her store to buy a @entity0. She picks out a red @entity0. It is small enough to fit in her hand. It costs Seventy Five cents. She buys it. She leaves the store. When @entity2 gets home, she has no one to play with. She looks for her friend @entity4. @entity4 is not at home. She looks for her friend @entity1. @entity1 is not allowed to go outside. @entity2 finds a dog named @entity3. @entity3 loves to play frisbee. @entity2 tosses the frisbee to @entity3. @entity3 catches it in her mouth. @entity3 brings the frisbee back to @entity2. @entity2 tosses the frisbee again. @entity3 jumps up in the air and catches it. @entity2 throws the @entity0 one more time. The @entity0 lands in a tree. @entity2 is too short to reach the @entity0. @entity2 pets @entity3 and tells her that she is a good girl. @entity2 takes @entity3 home. They eat cookies. The next day, they come back to the park. They get their @entity0 back. They play again.
