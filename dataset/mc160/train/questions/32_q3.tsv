This hurt@entity3's feelings a lot. The girls kept on playing and @entity3 was trying to have fun, but allshe felt like doing was crying. She could not believe that she had not been invited to@entity1's birthday party. She thought that they were friends and if her best friend @entity4had been invited, why not her?After recess was over, the class walked back into the school. @entity3 saw @entity1 in line andtried to smile, but it was hard. @entity4 felt horrible now that she had talked about theparty that her friend was not going to.@entity3 found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and overwhy @entity1 did not invite her to the party. @entity0 @entity3 do something to make @entity1 mad orto hurt her? She could not understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She washoping that no one saw this. @entity3 thought she saw @entity1 looking at her in a funnyway. Suddenly @entity3 felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk topull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there wasthe invitation to @entity1's party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. Sheimmediately started to smile. She smiled at @entity1 and at @entity4. @entity4 gave her a puzzledlook because she thought that @entity3 was sad.
