On Saturday, @entity0 and @entity2 baked a whole chicken for their family's dinner.  They rinsed it in cold water, rubbed it with spices, and put it into a pan.  After they had heated up the oven, they put the chicken and the pan on the center oven rack and set the timer.  Then, as they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, @entity0, @entity2 and @entity3 talked about dinner. @entity0 said, "@entity2, this is too much food for you, me and little @entity3 to eat in one night. We'll have leftovers.  What can we do with the leftover chicken?" @entity2 said, "We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice." @entity0 said, "How about chicken soup?" @entity3 said, "I like chicken with @entity1 noodles with red peppers.  We have not made those in a long time."  "That sounds good," said @entity0.  "We'll make that for dinner tomorrow." "Yum!" said @entity2.  "That's a great idea.  I love @entity1 noodles." Later, @entity2, @entity0 and @entity3 had finished eating dinner, and @entity3 asked @entity0 for help with her homework.  "I do not understand how to do these math problems!" @entity2 said, "You two go ahead.  I'll do the dishes and put away the leftovers." Soon, @entity3 went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.  @entity2 was eating the chicken. It was almost gone! "Dad!" said @entity3, "You have eaten almost all of the leftover chicken. We ca not have @entity1 noodles with chicken tomorrow." @entity2 looked very sad.  He said "I'm sorry.  I have been a bad dad.  I have to buy more chicken so that we can still have noodles.  Would you like a piece of chicken?"
