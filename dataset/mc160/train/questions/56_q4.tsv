The dog was playing in the street outside. I walked past the dog and threw the ball to him. He seemed to be hot from the heat of the day. I then headed to the store because I needed to buy some food and other things that were needed. I entered the store and said hi to @entity0. He had been working at the store for a long time. I walked to the back of the store and picked up some cold sodas and a bottle of orange juice. I then went and picked up some popcorn. This would be good for eating later while watching tv. I then went to the dog food section and picked a meat treat for the dog. I then went up to the front of the store and paid @entity0. He smiled and thanked me for shopping at his store. Then I walked back to my house and looked at the dog. His name was @entity1 and had lived with us for around four years. His coat was brown and white. I unwrapped the dog treat and gave it to him. @entity1 seemed happy and started to lick my hand in happiness. He was a good dog and it made me feel good that he was happy.
