A dancer named @entity2 was part of the @entity3 and @entity0. Shespent all hours of the day practicing for her recital. @entity2 had difficulties doing bothher schoolwork and her dancing; she often fell behind in math. Her best friend @entity4 wasalso a dancer; they often competed with each other to get the top parts in the dances.Their moms thought that because they competed with each other they might become meantowards one another but they did not let that get in the way of their friendship.In their latest recital @entity2 had got the top part in the dance called "The @entity1 and theRain". The hours were long and draining on their bodies. All the girls and boys who leftthe performance center looked so tired. They could not pick up their practice bags off ofthe floor as they walked to their parents to go home and their eyelids were droopy. When@entity2 got home, the last thing on her mind was her math problems. All she could think ofwas bathing her sore feet and her head hitting her soft fluffy pillow.  Her teachersstarted to become aware of @entity2's problems in the classroom and called her parents intoschool to talk to her teachers. Her parents knew that dancing was @entity2's dream and wouldnot let anything get in the way of her performances. It was important for her parents for@entity2 to do well in all parts of her life, but her dancing is what lit a fire in hereyes. Her parents got her extra help to help with her homework, which helped @entity2 keeptrack of all parts of her life.
