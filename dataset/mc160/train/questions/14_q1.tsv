Once upon a time there was a cute brown puppy. He was a very happy puppy. His name was @entity1. @entity1 had a best friend. His name was @entity3. @entity3 had a nice dad named @entity4. @entity3 and @entity1 had been friends for almost a year. @entity1 and @entity3 loved to play in the big back yard. Sometimes, @entity3 would ask his friend @entity0 to come to the back yard and play with them. @entity0 would always bring his puppy too. @entity0's puppy was named @entity2. @entity3 and  @entity0 would run around the back yard and @entity1 and @entity2 chased them and barked. They all had so much fun playing together. One day, @entity3 told @entity1 that tomorrow would be a very special day. It would be @entity1's birthday. @entity1 was very excited. The next day came and @entity3 threw a birthday party for @entity1. All of @entity1's friends were there and they had presents for him. @entity0 brought @entity1 a new ball and @entity2 brought him a bone. There was one more present for @entity1 to open. When he opened the gift from @entity3, @entity1 was so exited that he jumped and barked. It was a new red collar with a shiny name tag on it. It was the best gift @entity1 had ever been given.
