One night I was at my friend's house where he threw a party. We were enjoying our dinnerat night when all of a sudden we heard a knock on the door. I opened the door and saw thisguy who had scar on his face. I asked my friend "who is that guy?", and he told me that itwas his friend. I did not trust that guy because he looked very strange.After we had dinner the strange guy asked my friend to come outside because he wanted totalk to him. A few seconds later I heard a noise from outside and when I ran outside I sawthat the strange guy was trying to beat my friend. I ran towards him and asked him toleave our house. He left the house but after half an hour he came back and this time hewas dressed up as superhero and he also had a sword. As soon as I saw him I ran inside thehouse and called the cops. The cops came and the guy ran away as soon as he heard the copcar coming. We never found out what happened to that guy after that day.
