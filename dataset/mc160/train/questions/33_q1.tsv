A boy named @entity3 in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves.He is cold. It is snowing where he lives. He lives in Argentina.It's warm where she lives in @entity4. She eats fresh fruit.  Her shower is outdoors underthe warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him.She remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always,  becauseshe is older.He did not care. @entity3 was poor, so he could not visit her. Maybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she did not want tobring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time.Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. @entity2, "close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of anything that feels like clouds. @entity5 puppies hugging you, and kitties purring withyou. @entity5 you are eating chocolate ice cream!As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as @entity3! And youcan think of @entity0 ways you can see him again!"It worked! She had an idea. @entity1 in a place called MR was buying stories that peoplewrote. She wrote one about her & @entity3!It paid for her airplane ride. Wow.Then they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, "Thank youeveryone,  for helping us!"
