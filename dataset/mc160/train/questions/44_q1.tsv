@entity5 walked out the door with a huge grin on his face. It was his first day of middle school. His mom, who is a nurse at the high school, waved at him as he entered the bus. The bus driver said "good to see you @entity5". @entity5 said "you too @entity2".  @entity5 was so excited to see his friends that he could barely breathe. As he walked down the school bus, @entity5's friends @entity3, @entity1, @entity0 and @entity4 all waved to him. Instead of sitting next to his best friend @entity4, @entity5 turned left and sat next to @entity3. @entity0 and @entity1 started laughing at him and teased "@entity5 and @entity3 sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G". @entity5's face turned red from embarrassment.  @entity4 felt bad for @entity5 and reached into his pockets to help his friend. When he reached in, he felt a pencil, a rock and a folded up piece of paper. @entity4's eyes twinkled. He had a plan. Without @entity1 and @entity0 seeing, @entity4 quickly made a paper airplane with the piece of paper he found in his pocket. He threw the paper airplane at @entity1. The plane hit @entity1 in the face. Both @entity1 and @entity0 stopped laughing. @entity5 looked over to @entity4 and smiled.
