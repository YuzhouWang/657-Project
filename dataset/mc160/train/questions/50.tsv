So, every day after school, @entity0 would make @entity1 abig bowl of oatmeal and take it outside for @entity1 to enjoy.  @entity1 would see @entity0 andwalk up to him as fast as a turtle can go.  @entity0 would put the bowl down and wait for@entity1 to come up to the bowl to eat from it. When @entity1 reached the bowl, he put hisnose on it.  But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat.  @entity0 reached down and blew on the hotoatmeal, to cool it down for @entity1 to eat.
