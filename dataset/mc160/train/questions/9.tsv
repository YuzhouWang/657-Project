In a far away land known as @entity5, there was a great man named @entity1. This was a very oddland because the only thing to do was play chess. @entity1 did not very much care for chess ashe was very bored with it. Another problem @entity1 had was that he did not like some of theother people in this land. They had names like @entity6, @entity3, @entity0, and @entity2. And mostof all, there was King. He was the greatest person in @entity5. One day, during their normalbattle, @entity1 saw an opening to move to the far end of @entity5. He almost got hurt by @entity2but he got away. Amazingly, when he got to the other end he became as powerful as@entity3. With this amazing power, @entity1 chose to help keep King safe. All was well until @entity1woke up and knew that it was only a dream. He was still @entity1.
