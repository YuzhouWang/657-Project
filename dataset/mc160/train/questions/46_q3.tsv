Two kittens were playing. They had come in from outside. Now they were in the living roomin the house. One kitten was named @entity1 and one kitten was named @entity0. Suddenly,@entity1 saw something interesting."Look at that!" said @entity1."What is it?" asked @entity0."It's a ball of yarn. On the top shelf!" said @entity1. She had seen the yarn that waskept in a basket up there!"That looks like it's fun to play with!" said @entity0. "But how could we get to it? It's sohigh up," he wondered."I have an idea," said @entity1. "Watch this!" Suddenly, @entity1 jumped up on to the couch."What are  you doing?" asked @entity0."Just watch!" said @entity1. @entity1 then jumped to the table next to the couch. Then,she jumped to the middle shelf."That's dangerous!" said @entity0. @entity1 and @entity0 were still small kittens. They were notused to jumping very high yet."Do not worry, I'll be careful. I think we're allowed to be up here." said @entity1. Then,she jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was. "Look out below!" she yelled,and pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor."Whoa!" said @entity0. "Thanks!" @entity1 then jumped down to the middle shelf, and down tothe table, and down to the couch, and back to the floor. There, she and her brother playedwith the ball of yarn until they got tired and took a nap.
