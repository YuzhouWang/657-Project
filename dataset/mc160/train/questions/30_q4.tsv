@entity1 was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but@entity1 hated to sew quilts. She did not like anything about sewing quilts and blanketsbecause it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirttook one night! @entity1's mother did not understand why @entity1 did not like to sew quilts andblankets because @entity1's mother loved to!@entity1 was a normal little girl even if her friends did not think so all the time. @entity1'sfriends liked to play games and play outside but all @entity1 liked was to sew. She woke upand she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. @entity1's father was veryworried about @entity1. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all thetime. One day @entity1's father took @entity1's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. "Nomore sewing, @entity1!" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead ofsew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. @entity1 was verysad that she could not sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why @entity1 had not comeover to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they hadto think of a way to cheer her up. @entity0 said that maybe they could let her sew at theirhouses. @entity2 thought it was a great idea. So then all @entity1's friends bought sewing thingswith their money so that @entity1 would be happy again. When @entity1's father saw @entity1 go to oneof her friend's house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.
