@entity1 was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but @entity1 hated to sew quilts. She did not like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night! @entity1's mother did not understand why @entity1 did not like to sew quilts and blankets because @entity1's mother loved to! @entity1 was a normal little girl even if her friends did not think so all the time. @entity1's friends liked to play games and play outside but all @entity1 liked was to sew. She woke up and she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. @entity1's father was very worried about @entity1. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.  One day @entity1's father took @entity1's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. "No more sewing, @entity1!" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. @entity1 was very sad that she could not sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why @entity1 had not come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. @entity0 said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. @entity2 thought it was a great idea. So then all @entity1's friends bought sewing things with their money so that @entity1 would be happy again. When @entity1's father saw @entity1 go to one of her friend's house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.
