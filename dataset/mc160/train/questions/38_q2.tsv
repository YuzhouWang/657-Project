As they went to the doors they saw they had the letters A, B, C, and D on them. What did itmean? @entity5, the leader, told everyone to stop and look at the doors, so as to see whichdoor they would go through. The walls were brown and dirty. The lights were yellow. @entity3 Awas blue. This was @entity2's choice. @entity3 B was red. @entity3 C was the same color as @entity0. @entity3 D a color no one had seen before. @entity6 felt that @entity5 needed to make a choicesoon before the monsters caught their scent. @entity4 was the first to voice a choice. Hewanted to go in the red door. @entity5 told him that the old books said to go in the bluedoor. This is why it was so hard for @entity5 right now. Two doors were blue. Being a goodleader, @entity5 asked everyone what they wanted to do. The final choice was door D. Theywent in and enjoyed all of time in a world with odd colors.
