There was a big race in town. @entity3 and @entity0 were friends. @entity3 was faster than @entity0. On the day of the race, they wished each other good luck. @entity0 tripped on a rock during the race. She cried but another one of her friends, @entity2, helped her stand up. @entity3 cheered for her to finish after she crossed the line. On the next day @entity0 came into school with a bruise on her knee. @entity1 thought she looked silly. They were in the same class. @entity1 did not make fun of @entity0. She gave her a bandage instead. It had a cat on it to match @entity0's shirt. @entity0 was still unhappy. She would not eat her lunch or play at recess. When @entity3 tried to talk to her she frowned. Then @entity3 gave @entity0 a bunny toy that she liked. @entity0 smiled. She gave @entity3 a hug.
