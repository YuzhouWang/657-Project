Two best friends lived in a small town. They grew up together and did everything together. One boy was named @entity0, and he was a cute, fat kid who was always picked on. And then the other boy was named @entity1, and he was handsome and cool. They were opposites, but they did not care. @entity1 would always protect @entity0 from the bullies because @entity0 was weak. One day, @entity0 was being teased by the bullies, @entity2 and @entity3, but @entity1 was not there to save him. @entity0 did not know what to do and was scared. But then he remembered all of the times @entity1 stood up for him. @entity0 looked up to @entity1 and he thought of him as his hero. @entity0 wanted to protect himself and not have @entity1 always come to help. So this time, @entity0 got up and was brave. He stood up to @entity2 and @entity3 and told them that he was not scared. The bullies did not know what to do and then gave up. They went away to look for more fun things to do. @entity1 saw the whole thing and was proud of @entity0 for being brave. Now @entity0 and @entity1 protect each other and stand up for each other. They still are the best of friends.
