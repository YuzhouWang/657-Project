In a quiet house there was a dog named @entity1. @entity1 was a little brown puppy and he was always getting into trouble. One day @entity1 got outside and walked down the street. He found a trash can and started to dig through it. A cat came also to see what @entity1 was doing. "Excuse me, but what are you looking for?" asked the cat. "Well, nothing important," @entity1 told the cat. "I wanted to see if there was anything cool in there." The cat told @entity1 that his name was @entity0 and asked if he could dig through the trash too. "Sure thing" @entity1 told the cat. The two of them started to dig through the trash again. After a little bit the pair got bored and started to walk down the street going away from @entity1's house. They walked to a river and went to the edge of the water. They saw they were dirty because they had been digging in the trash so they went into the water to wash themselves. When they were clean they went back to @entity1's house. Inside the house they got water on everything because they were still wet. @entity1's human's came home and were very upset that their house was now very wet.
