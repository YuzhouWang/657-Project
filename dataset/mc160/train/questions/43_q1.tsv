@entity0 and her friend @entity1 were bored one Saturday.  It was a hot summer day.  They did not want to stay inside any longer but they did not know what to do.  They were tired of watching TV inside.  Suddenly, @entity1 had an idea.  She said, "@entity0, we could make some money."  "How?," asked @entity0.  "Well, it is hot outside," said @entity1. "People are thirsty out there.  We could make money by making some lemonade and iced tea and have people pay for it."  "That is a great idea," answered @entity0, "let's do it!" @entity1 had made some iced tea with her mom earlier that day.  She asked her mom permission to use it.  Her mom said yes.  She and @entity1 made two pitchers of lemonade.  They got a cooler full of ice and made a sign so people knew what was for sale.  @entity1's mom helped them get a table and chairs and set up out on the corner in their neighborhood.  It was so hot out that people who saw their stand came to buy drinks right away. Their first visitors to their stand were their friends, @entity3 and @entity2.  In a half hour, they had to close their stand. They were all out of lemonade and iced tea.  They had made a lot of money. They split the money and each got ten dollars.  It was a great day.
