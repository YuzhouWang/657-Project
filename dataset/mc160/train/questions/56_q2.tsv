The dog was playing in the street outside. I walked past the dog and threw the ball tohim. He seemed to be hot from the heat of the day. I then headed to the store because @entity3 to buy some food and other things that were needed. I entered the store and said hito @entity0. He had been working at the store for a long time. I walked to the back ofthe store and picked up some cold sodas and a bottle of orange juice. I then went andpicked up some popcorn. This would be good for eating later while watching tv. I then wentto the dog food section and picked a meat treat for the dog. I then went up to the frontof the store and paid @entity0. He smiled and thanked me for shopping at his store. @entity2 walked back to my house and looked at the dog. His name was @entity1 and had lived with usfor around four years. His coat was brown and white. I unwrapped the dog treat and gave itto him. @entity1 seemed happy and started to lick my hand in happiness. He was a good dog andit made me feel good that he was happy.
