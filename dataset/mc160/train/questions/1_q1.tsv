@entity0 has a pet cat named @entity1. @entity1 is black with a white spot on her chest. @entity1 also has white paws that look like little white mittens. @entity1 likes to sleep in the sun on her favorite chair. @entity1 also likes to drink creamy milk. @entity0 is excited because on Saturday, @entity1 turns two years old. After school on Friday, @entity0 rushes to the pet store. She wants to buy @entity1' birthday presents. Last year, she gave @entity1 a play mouse and a blue feather. For this birthday, @entity0 is going to give @entity1 a red ball of yarn and a bowl with a picture of a cat on the side. The picture is of a black cat. It looks a lot like @entity1.
