In a quiet house there was a dog named @entity2. @entity2 was a little brown puppy and hewas always getting into trouble. One day @entity2 got outside and walked down thestreet. He found a trash can and started to dig through it. A cat came also to see @entity0 was doing. "Excuse me, but what are you looking for?" asked the cat. "Well, nothingimportant," @entity2 told the cat. "I wanted to see if there was anything cool in there."The cat told @entity2 that his name was @entity1 and asked if he could dig through the trashtoo. "Sure thing" @entity2 told the cat. The two of them started to dig through the trashagain. After a little bit the pair got bored and started to walk down the street goingaway from @entity2's house. They walked to a river and went to the edge of the water. Theysaw they were dirty because they had been digging in the trash so they went into the waterto wash themselves. When they were clean they went back to @entity2's house. Inside thehouse they got water on everything because they were still wet. @entity2's human's camehome and were very upset that their house was now very wet.
