Today, @entity1 is hungry. She wants to eat somewhere in town. There is a popular diner in town. She goes there and asks them if she can get fries and a chocolate milkshake. Her friends come into the diner and sit with her. Their names are @entity0, @entity2 and @entity3. All of them are Fifteen years old. @entity2 gets a big cheeseburger with onions. @entity0 wants a vanilla ice cream cone with sprinkles. @entity3 does not eat anything. He talks with them instead. After they finish eating, they go back to @entity0's house to hang out and play games. @entity3 wins most of the puzzle games. @entity0 beats them at a few. They're racing games. @entity3 leaves after an hour. He needs to go do his reading homework. @entity2 and @entity1 leave that evening because it's a school night. They all promise to meet up again the next day to hang out after school.
