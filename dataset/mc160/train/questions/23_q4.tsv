@entity1 the cat lives with the @entity0 family. Before @entity1 lived with the @entity0 family he lived with the @entity2 family and before he lived with the @entity2 family he lived with the @entity3 family. The @entity0 family used to live in a cabin in the woods. Then they moved to an apartment in the city. Now they live in a house outside of the city. @entity1 liked all of the families that he had lived with but likes the @entity0 family the best. @entity1 likes living with the @entity0 family so much because they are nice to him and always play with him but also because they have lived in such great places. @entity1 liked living in the cabin in the woods and in the apartment in the city but neither of these were his were his favorite place to live. @entity1 favorite place to live is in the new house the @entity0 family bought outside of the city. The home is very large and @entity1 has a lot of room to run and play.
