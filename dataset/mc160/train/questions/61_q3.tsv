@entity1 had always a red bike. His birthday party was coming up and he hoped that his parents would finally get him the bike. When his friends came over for the party, @entity1 was very worried that he would not get the bike. He looked at all the presents and none of them seemed big enough to have a bike in them. @entity1 was sad. When it was time to open the presents he opened them one at a time. The first present was not a bike. The second present was not a bike. The third present was the biggest one. @entity1 knew if the bike was going to be in any of the presents it was going to be in this box. @entity1 opened it and there was no bike inside. Just as @entity1 tried not to look too upset, his @entity0 brought in the biggest present of them all. His @entity0 had been hiding the present all along. @entity1 opened it and his new bike was inside the box. @entity1 put the bike together with his @entity0's help.
