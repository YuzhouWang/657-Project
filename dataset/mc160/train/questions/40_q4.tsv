Once upon a time there were three rabbits, named @entity0, @entity2, and @entity1. @entity2 was a brown rabbit with large eyes. @entity1 was grey and white and had messy fur. @entity0 was black and very fat. They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat. Every day they would leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow of grass. They loved to eat that grass. One day, @entity2 thought he smelled something interesting. At first he thought it might be dirt. Then he thought maybe some sort of flower. So, he asked a nearby squirrel. The squirrel's name was @entity3. @entity3 said that he thought it was mushrooms. However, @entity1, the smartest rabbit, went to go look, and he learned that it was actually a garden of carrots. The rabbits were all excited. They all loved carrots! They ate all the carrots.
