@entity2 had to fix some things around the house. He had to fix the door. He had to fix the window. But before he did anything he had to fix the toilet. @entity2 called over his best friend @entity1 to help him. @entity1 brought with him his friends Molly and @entity0. @entity2 thought that @entity1 was going to bring Dolly with him but he did not. The four of them got to work right away. Fixing the toilet was easy. Fixing the door was also easy but fixing the window was very hard. The window was stuck and could not be opened. They all pushed on the window really hard until finally it opened. Once the window was fixed the four of them made a delicious dinner and talked about all of the good work that they had done. @entity2 was glad that he had such good friends to help him with his work.
