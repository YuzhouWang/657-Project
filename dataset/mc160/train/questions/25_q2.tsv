The @entity4s have not lost any games either.  The score was oneto one until the last inning.  There were two outs.  @entity5 came to the plate.  The pitchernamed @entity2 threw the ball hard.  @entity5 swung his bat too late and missed.  He missed thenext pitch too.  It was too fast.  He was ready for the next pitch.  He hit it hard tocenter field.  The @entity4 player in center field jumped to catch it, but it went over hishead and over the fence.  It was a home run!  The @entity7 won the game!
