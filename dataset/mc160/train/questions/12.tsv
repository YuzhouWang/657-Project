@entity0 is going to the baseball field with his friend @entity1.@entity0 has to practice because baseball season starts in a week.He wants to be a good player when the season starts.@entity0 has been lazy in practicing so he is not very good at baseball right now.He has to make up for it by playing baseball for Five hours every day for a week.@entity0 thinks this is enough practice for him to catch up and be a good player when theseason starts.So @entity0 and @entity1 practice every day.  They throw the ball around.  They practice battingand they practice fielding.@entity1 begins to see that @entity0 is getting better every day.  He says "I do not believe it,@entity0, but I think you are going to be pretty good when the season starts!"Usually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but @entity0 is practicingso much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.Then @entity0 has a setback.  His glove rips during practice.  He ca not keep playing with abroken glove!So @entity1 and @entity0 go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for eachbottle.@entity0 misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirtydollars.This is enough money for @entity0 to buy a new glove!So @entity0 buys a new glove and he and @entity1 go back to the field and practice somemore.By the time the season comes @entity0 is one of the best players on his team.
