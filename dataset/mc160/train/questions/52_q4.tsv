They all became very  happy. Then @entity1's friend came. @entity1 liked his friend very much. @entity1 went off the swing and went away with his friend. Then @entity4 and @entity0 felt very very sad. Happily then @entity4 and @entity0's friend came. Their friend's name was @entity3. She was the same age as @entity0. They wanted to go to the slide together. So they went to the slide and played for a long time. Then @entity4 became happy. And @entity0 also became happy.
