@entity3 and @entity4 love to play basketball.  They like it better than soccer and baseball.Their other friend, @entity5, has his own basketball hoop.  He got it for his ninth birthday.@entity3 got a football for his birthday and @entity4 got a skateboard.  They like their presents,but think the basketball hoop is better.  They play basketball at @entity5's house with himand any other kids who show up.  @entity0 and @entity1 come almost every day and @entity2, Ty, andMax come sometimes.  Next year, they all get to play on a basketball team.  They get toplay at their school.  They are very excited about that and ca not wait to play on a realteam.  For now, they are practicing a lot and are trying to get really good.  They playevery day they can.
