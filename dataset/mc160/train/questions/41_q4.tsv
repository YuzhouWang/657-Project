Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind islike someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleeplately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she did not know what else to do but liedown and try to rest a little.Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept hermind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girland her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, andshe and her younger sister had their own room in the back.It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound gotlouder. It did not seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the otherside of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still lookedfive years old. The old woman could not remember her any other way, as she had died from asickness at age five."What's wrong?" she asked her sister. "I miss you. I am so lonely," answered the littlegirl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reachedfor her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling."She died in her sleep." "It is best that way."
