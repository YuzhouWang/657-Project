@entity3 and @entity4 love to play basketball.  They like it better than soccer and baseball. Their other friend, @entity5, has his own basketball hoop.  He got it for his ninth birthday. @entity3 got a football for his birthday and @entity4 got a skateboard.  They like their presents, but think the basketball hoop is better.  They play basketball at @entity5's house with him and any other kids who show up.  @entity0 and @entity1 come almost every day and @entity2, Ty, and Max come sometimes.  Next year, they all get to play on a basketball team.  They get to play at their school.  They are very excited about that and ca not wait to play on a real team.  For now, they are practicing a lot and are trying to get really good.  They play every day they can.  They are trying to be as good as the @entity6 players they watch on TV. They dream of someday playing in the @entity6.  They are sure it is going to happen.
