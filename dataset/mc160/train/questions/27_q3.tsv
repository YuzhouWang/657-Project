There once was a big black and white dog named @entity0. His owner's name was @entity1. @entity1 thought he was the best dog in the whole world. One night, when @entity0 and @entity1 were taking a walk in the park, they saw two men walking down the path. Both men were dressed in very nice suits. @entity1 waved at the men.  "Good evening," he said. "How are you tonight?" "Hello," one of the men said. "It is such a great night for walking." @entity1 and @entity0 kept walking down the path. It was a very dark night, but the moon was shining bright. When @entity1 turned around to look for the two men, he could not see them at all. They were nowhere to be seen. Later that night, when their walk was over, @entity1 and @entity0 were lying on the bed. They were watching a television show about ghosts. "Do you think maybe those two men were ghosts?" @entity1 said out loud. "They did not leave a trace." @entity0 was a dog, but he acted like he understood. He barked. @entity1 smiled. He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did.
