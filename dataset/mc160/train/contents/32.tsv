Cindy had been invited to it, but Mary had not. This hurt\newlineMary's feelings a lot. The girls kept on playing and Mary was trying to have fun, but all\newlineshe felt like doing was crying. She couldn't believe that she had not been invited to\newlineAllison's birthday party. She thought that they were friends and if her best friend Cindy\newlinehad been invited, why not her?\newline\newlineAfter recess was over, the class walked back into the school. Mary saw Allison in line and\newlinetried to smile, but it was hard. Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the\newlineparty that her friend was not going to.\newline\newlineMary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over\newlinewhy Allison didn't invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or\newlineto hurt her? She couldn't understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was\newlinehoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny\newlineway. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to\newlinepull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was\newlinethe invitation to Allison's party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She\newlineimmediately started to smile. She smiled at Allison and at Cindy. Cindy gave her a puzzled\newlinelook because she thought that Mary was sad. \newline\newlineAt lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy. Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to\newlineplay.	multiple: What did Mary find in her desk?	a test	a birthday invitation	a teacher	a sandwich	one: How did Mary feel at the end of the story?	sad	mad	happy	grumpy	multiple: Who did we think was not invited to the party?
