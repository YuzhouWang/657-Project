One day as he was walking down the road\newlinea little brown and spotted puppy came up to him and wanted James to pet him. James reached\newlinedown and petted the puppy and smiled. James hoped to see the puppy again. Many days later\newlineJames went for a walk again. He thought to himself, "I guess I won't ever see the brown\newlinepuppy again. I hoped to see him again." A nice young lady said to James, "Would you like a\newlinepuppy?" James said, "I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before." The\newlinelady smiled. She was holding the little brown and spotted puppy. She told James that she\newlinefound the little puppy in the woods. She said that the little puppy did not have a\newlinefamily. James said happily, "I would love to give the puppy a home!" So James grabbed the\newlinelittle brown and spotted puppy and took him home.
