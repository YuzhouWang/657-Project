Alpha, the leader, told everyone to stop and look at the doors, so as to see which\newlinedoor they would go through. The walls were brown and dirty. The lights were yellow. Door A\newlinewas blue. This was Beta's choice. Door B was red. Door C was the same color as door\newlineA. Door D a color no one had seen before. Gamma felt that Alpha needed to make a choice\newlinesoon before the monsters caught their scent. Delta was the first to voice a choice. He\newlinewanted to go in the red door. Alpha told him that the old books said to go in the blue\newlinedoor. This is why it was so hard for Alpha right now. Two doors were blue. Being a good\newlineleader, Alpha asked everyone what they wanted to do. The final choice was door D. They\newlinewent in and enjoyed all of time in a world with odd colors.	multiple: What color was door C?	blue	red	yellow	brown	one: Who was the leader?
