We went to the zoo!\newline\newlineI saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw\newlinemonkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.\newline\newlineWe even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In\newlinefact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there\newlinewere lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water\newlineto feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but\newlineI was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying\newlineeverywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said\newlinebutterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the\newlineroom.\newline\newlineGuess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door!\newlineThe man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me\newlineto stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I\newlinewas sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of\newlinethere!\newline\newlineI stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.\newline\newlineSince then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be\newlineafraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my\newlinebrother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find\newlinebutterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me\newlineand I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!	multiple: Where did the child go when he saw the butterflies?
