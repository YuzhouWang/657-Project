They didn't\newlinewant to stay inside any longer but they didn't know what to do.  They were tired of\newlinewatching TV inside.  Suddenly, Kara had an idea.  She said, "Bailey, we could make some\newlinemoney."  "How?," asked Bailey.  "Well, it is hot outside," said Kara. "People are thirsty\newlineout there.  We could make money by making some lemonade and iced tea and have people pay\newlinefor it."  "That is a great idea," answered Bailey, "let's do it!" Kara had made some iced\newlinetea with her mom earlier that day.  She asked her mom permission to use it.  Her mom said\newlineyes.  She and Kara made two pitchers of lemonade.  They got a cooler full of ice and made\newlinea sign so people knew what was for sale.  Kara's mom helped them get a table and chairs\newlineand set up out on the corner in their neighborhood.  It was so hot out that people who saw\newlinetheir stand came to buy drinks right away. Their first visitors to their stand were their\newlinefriends, Abby and Molly.  In a half hour, they had to close their stand. They were all\newlineout of lemonade and iced tea.  They had made a lot of money. They split the money and each\newlinegot ten dollars.
