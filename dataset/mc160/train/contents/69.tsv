mc160.train.69	Author: 2168620107;Work Time(s): 448	Mary loved walking through the woods with her dog, Max.  Max and Mary would go on all\newlinesorts of adventures together.  They really loved looking for blueberries together and then\newlinefalling asleep next to each other in the tall grass.  One day, as Mary was picking the\newlineblueberries, she turned around to find that Max was not there.  She became worried and ran\newlineoff to look for her dog.  \newline\newlineShe looked in all of their favorite spots...next to the stream, in their secret hiding place\newlinebehind the raspberry bushes, and even inside the old cabin that sat in the woods.  But\newlinepoor Max was nowhere to be found.  Nonetheless, Mary would not give up.   She kept looking\newlineand she found him not very far away.  He had seen a squirrel and run to chase it.  When\newlineMary called Max's name he left the squirrel and happily returned to Mary, wagging his tail\newlineas he went.	multiple: How did Max feel when Mary found him at the end of the story?
