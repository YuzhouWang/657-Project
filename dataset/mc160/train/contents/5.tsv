She was the only person at the park. "How strange,\newlinewhere is everyone?" she thought. Martha looked everywhere. She looked inside the\newlinerestrooms, under the benches, and even at the top of the slide. She was confused. Usually,\newlineshe would see her friends playing with each other. She started walking again when one of\newlineher friends popped up, surprising her. Her friend asked her, "Why are you outside?" Martha\newlineasked what she meant, and explained that she always came out to the park to play. Her\newlinefriend then looked at her strangely and asked, "Didn't Stephan invite you to his party?"\newlineMartha hadn't known that Stephan was holding a party. She was sad that he hadn't invited\newlineher. She walked back home, upset.	multiple: Who didn't invite Martha to the party?	The park	No one	Martha	Stephan	multiple: Why was Martha confused?
