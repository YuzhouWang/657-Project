One day Bentley got outside and walked down the\newlinestreet. He found a trash can and started to dig through it. A cat came also to see what\newlineBentley was doing. "Excuse me, but what are you looking for?" asked the cat. "Well, nothing\newlineimportant," Bentley told the cat. "I wanted to see if there was anything cool in there."\newlineThe cat told Bentley that his name was Felix and asked if he could dig through the trash\newlinetoo. "Sure thing" Bentley told the cat. The two of them started to dig through the trash\newlineagain. After a little bit the pair got bored and started to walk down the street going\newlineaway from Bentley's house. They walked to a river and went to the edge of the water. They\newlinesaw they were dirty because they had been digging in the trash so they went into the water\newlineto wash themselves. When they were clean they went back to Bentley's house. Inside the\newlinehouse they got water on everything because they were still wet. Bentley's human's came\newlinehome and were very upset that their house was now very wet.	one: Why were Bentley's human's upset?
