Jeff\newlinethought he was the best dog in the whole world.\newline\newlineOne night, when Forrest and Jeff were taking a walk in the park, they saw two men walking\newlinedown the path. Both men were dressed in very nice suits.\newline\newlineJeff waved at the men. \newline\newline"Good evening," he said. "How are you tonight?"\newline\newline"Hello," one of the men said. "It is such a great night for walking."\newline\newlineJeff and Forrest kept walking down the path. It was a very dark night, but the moon was\newlineshining bright. When Jeff turned around to look for the two men, he could not see them at\newlineall. They were nowhere to be seen.\newline\newlineLater that night, when their walk was over, Jeff and Forrest were lying on the bed. They\newlinewere watching a television show about ghosts.\newline\newline"Do you think maybe those two men were ghosts?" Jeff said out loud. "They did not leave a\newlinetrace."\newline\newlineForrest was a dog, but he acted like he understood. He barked.\newline\newlineJeff smiled. He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did.	multiple: What time of day did Jeff and Forrest go for a walk?	morning	afternoon	night	lunchtime	multiple: Why did Jeff think the men were ghosts?	they looked scary	they chased him and his dog	they were howling	they disappeared	one: What was the name of Jeff's dog?
