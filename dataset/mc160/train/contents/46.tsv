One kitten was named Snowball and one kitten was named Fuzzy. Suddenly,\newlineSnowball saw something interesting.\newline\newline"Look at that!" said Snowball.\newline\newline"What is it?" asked Fuzzy.\newline\newline"It's a ball of yarn. On the top shelf!" said Snowball. She had seen the yarn that was\newlinekept in a basket up there!\newline\newline"That looks like it's fun to play with!" said Fuzzy. "But how could we get to it? It's so\newlinehigh up," he wondered.\newline\newline"I have an idea," said Snowball. "Watch this!" Suddenly, Snowball jumped up on to the couch.\newline\newline"What are  you doing?" asked Fuzzy.\newline\newline"Just watch!" said Snowball. Snowball then jumped to the table next to the couch. Then,\newlineshe jumped to the middle shelf.\newline\newline"That's dangerous!" said Fuzzy. Snowball and Fuzzy were still small kittens. They weren't\newlineused to jumping very high yet.\newline\newline"Don't worry, I'll be careful. I think we're allowed to be up here." said Snowball. Then,\newlineshe jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was. "Look out below!" she yelled,\newlineand pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor.\newline\newline"Whoa!" said Fuzzy. "Thanks!"
