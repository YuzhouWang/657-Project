mc160.train.30	Author: 120746547;Work Time(s): 2063	Mary was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but\newlineMary hated to sew quilts. She didn't like anything about sewing quilts and blankets\newlinebecause it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt\newlinetook one night! Mary's mother didn't understand why Mary didn't like to sew quilts and\newlineblankets because Mary's mother loved to!\newline\newlineMary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn't think so all the time. Mary's\newlinefriends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew. She woke up\newlineand she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. Mary's father was very\newlineworried about Mary. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the\newlinetime. \newline\newlineOne day Mary's father took Mary's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. "No\newlinemore sewing, Mary!" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of\newlinesew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very\newlinesad that she couldn't sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come\newlineover to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had\newlineto think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their\newlinehouses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things\newlinewith their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary's father saw Mary go to one\newlineof her friend's house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.	multiple: What did Mary like to sew?	blankets, dresses, and shirts.	dresses, shirts, and skirts.	quilts, blankets, and shirts.	quilts, dresses, and skirts.	one: What was the little girl's name in the story?
