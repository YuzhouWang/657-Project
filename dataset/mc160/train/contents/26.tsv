mc160.train.26	Author: 292850894;Work Time(s): 7613	There was once a land named Catatonia where cats ran things. Cats walked and talked much\newlineas you do except they walked on four legs. There were cat policemen, cat firemen, cat\newlineteachers, and even a cat bus driver. Most of the cats were very busy.\newline   \newlineThe King of Catatonia was a small cat named Diggs. He had two brothers named Pouncer and\newlineFlash who helped him rule in Catatonia. Pouncer was head of the Milk, Cheese and Cream\newlinecenter and Flash's job was to blow things up. Together the three of them made sure all\newlinethe cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in the\newlinedistance.\newline    \newlineOne day Pouncer's wife brought the kittens to see Pouncer at his office. There were white\newlinekittens and lots of black and white spotted kittens walking around in the Milk, Cheese and\newlineCream center.\newline   \newlineWell that is all the time we have for now. I hope this short story of the Cats of\newlineCatatonia made at least one person in the room smile.	one: What type of job was NOT in the story?
