Francis was grey and white and had messy fur. Winston\newlinewas black and very fat. They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat. Every day they\newlinewould leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow of\newlinegrass. They loved to eat that grass. One day, Chester thought he smelled something\newlineinteresting. At first he thought it might be dirt. Then he thought maybe some sort of\newlineflower. So, he asked a nearby squirrel. The squirrel's name was Acorn. Acorn said that he\newlinethought it was mushrooms. However, Francis, the smartest rabbit, went to go look, and he\newlinelearned that it was actually a garden of carrots. The rabbits were all excited. They all\newlineloved carrots! They ate all the carrots.	multiple: What was the interesting smell?	Carrots	A flower	Mushrooms	Dirt	one: What color is Winston?	White	Black	Brown	Grey	one: Who smelled something interesting?
