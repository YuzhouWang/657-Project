I then headed to the store because I\newlineneeded to buy some food and other things that were needed. I entered the store and said hi\newlineto Mr. Jones. He had been working at the store for a long time. I walked to the back of\newlinethe store and picked up some cold sodas and a bottle of orange juice. I then went and\newlinepicked up some popcorn. This would be good for eating later while watching tv. I then went\newlineto the dog food section and picked a meat treat for the dog. I then went up to the front\newlineof the store and paid Mr. Jones. He smiled and thanked me for shopping at his store. Then\newlineI walked back to my house and looked at the dog. His name was Rex and had lived with us\newlinefor around four years. His coat was brown and white. I unwrapped the dog treat and gave it\newlineto him. Rex seemed happy and started to lick my hand in happiness. He was a good dog and\newlineit made me feel good that he was happy.	multiple: what did I buy in the store	a meat pie	hot dogs and soda	a ball	popcorn, soda, juice, and dog treat	one: what color was the dog	brown and white	pure white	he was a good dog	he licked my hand	one: what is the name of the dog	Jones	Rin tin tin	Rex	Hazel	multiple: What did Mr. Jones do	he asked, "what are you doing here?"	he picked out a treat	he said, "we are closed"	he smiled and thanked me for shopping at his store
