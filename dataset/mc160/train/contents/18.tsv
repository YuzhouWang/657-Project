mc160.train.18	Author: 2332408363;Work Time(s): 368	The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from their\newlineschool. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who lived\newlinethere were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they\newlinewould plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they\newlineended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The\newlineNixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept\newlinea few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from\newlinetheir cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All\newlinethe kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby\newlinehills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many\newlinegoats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play\newlinewith their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with\newlinetheir dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and\newlinetiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. They\newlinewere a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought back\newlinestories for all the rest of the school to hear.	one: What did some of the class get to take home, other than stories?	corn	peanuts	chickens	milk	multiple: What animals tried to bump the children with their heads?	chickens	goats	cows	sheep	multiple: What did the Nixon family grow on their farm?	corn and wheat	vegetables	peanuts	apples and oranges	one: What animals stayed in the Nixons' barn?	cows and horses	sheep and hogs	goats and chickens	dogs and cats
