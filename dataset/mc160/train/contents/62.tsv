mc160.train.62	Author: 1028551157;Work Time(s): 2304	On Saturday, Amy and Joe baked a whole chicken for their family's dinner.  They rinsed it\newlinein cold water, rubbed it with spices, and put it into a pan.  After they had heated up the\newlineoven, they put the chicken and the pan on the center oven rack and set the timer.  Then,\newlineas they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, Amy, Joe and Cindy talked\newlineabout dinner.\newline\newlineAmy said, "Joe, this is too much food for you, me and little Cindy to eat in one night.\newlineWe'll have leftovers.  What can we do with the leftover chicken?"\newline\newlineJoe said, "We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice."\newline\newlineAmy said, "How about chicken soup?"\newline\newlineCindy said, "I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.  We haven't made those in\newlinea long time." \newline\newline"That sounds good," said Amy.  "We'll make that for dinner tomorrow."\newline\newline"Yum!" said Joe.  "That's a great idea.  I love Thai noodles."\newline\newlineLater, Joe, Amy and Cindy had finished eating dinner, and Cindy asked Amy for help with\newlineher homework.  "I don't understand how to do these math problems!"\newline\newlineJoe said, "You two go ahead.  I'll do the dishes and put away the leftovers."\newline\newlineSoon, Cindy went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.  Joe was eating the chicken.\newlineIt was almost gone!\newline\newline"Dad!" said Cindy, "You have eaten almost all of the leftover chicken. We can't have Thai\newlinenoodles with chicken tomorrow."\newline\newlineJoe looked very sad.  He said "I'm sorry.  I have been a bad dad.  I have to buy more\newlinechicken so that we can still have noodles.
