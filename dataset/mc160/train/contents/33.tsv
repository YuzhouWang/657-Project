He lives in Argentina.\newline\newlineIt's warm where she lives in Hawaii. She eats fresh fruit.  Her shower is outdoors under\newlinethe warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him.\newline\newlineShe remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always,  because\newlineshe is older.\newline\newlineHe didn't care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her. \newline\newlineMaybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she didn't want to\newlinebring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time.\newline\newlineThen an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. He\newlinesaid, "close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any\newlinething that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with\newlineyou. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!\newline\newlineAs long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you\newlinecan think of GREAT ways you can see him again!"\newline\newlineIt worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people\newlinewrote. She wrote one about her & Eduardo!\newline\newlineIt paid for her airplane ride. Wow.\newline\newlineThen they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, "Thank you\newlineeveryone,  for helping us!"	one: How does she travel to see the boy?
