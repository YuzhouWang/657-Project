It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep\newlinelately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie\newlinedown and try to rest a little.\newline\newlineOnce she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her\newlinemind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl\newlineand her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and\newlineshe and her younger sister had their own room in the back.\newline\newlineIt was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got\newlinelouder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other\newlineside of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked\newlinefive years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a\newlinesickness at age five.\newline\newline"What's wrong?" she asked her sister. "I miss you. I am so lonely," answered the little\newlinegirl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached\newlinefor her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.\newline\newline"She died in her sleep." "It is best that way."	multiple: What made the old woman nervous?	the sound of the wind	ghosts	cats	snakes	one: What was blowing outside the house?	bubbles	a storm	the wind	clouds	multiple: Who still looked five years old?	the old woman's little sister	the house	her mom and dad	the bed	multiple: Who did the younger sister miss?	the wind	the old woman	her mom	her pet bunny
