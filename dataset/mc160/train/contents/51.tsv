Two of her friends were going to the\newlinenearby beach to do some swimming and enjoy the sun. Jenny went with them and when they got\newlinethere the beach was very full and there were people everywhere.  They changed into their\newlinebathing suits and went to the water.  The water was very cold.  They chose not swim and\newlinewalked to the sand.  Then they laid down on some towels and enjoyed the sun.\newline\newlineAfter several hours Jenny and her friends fell asleep.  They woke up and the sun was\newlinebeginning to set.  When Jenny sat up she found that it was painful to touch her skin.\newlineWhen she looked down she saw that she had a very bad sunburn.  Her friends were also very\newlinebadly sunburned so they went home.  Jenny's mother gave her a cream to put on the sunburn.\newlineAfterwards she felt a lot better and went to sleep.	multiple: Where was Jenny when her mother gave her the cream for the sunburn?	the beach	school	home	the mall	one: How many friends did Jenny have with her?	4	1	2	6	multiple: Where did Jenny and her friends lay down on the towels to enjoy the sun?
