There were many houses in this town and they were\newlineall different colors, shapes and sizes. which made the people happy.  On one street there\newlinewas a red house, a green house, a blue house and one purple house with yellow stripes. The\newlinepeople in the town were all very friendly and knew each other well.\newline\newlineWhen the people of the town went out they loved to wear hats but never wore shoes and the\newlinehats were also many different colors, shapes and sizes. On Sundays all the families in\newlinetown would go to the park by the river and have picnics. The children would run, skip and\newlineplay and the parents would talk, eat and laugh. The children loved the picnic foods they\newlinehad. There were hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken and steak. They also had salads, coleslaw,\newlinefries and chips. The kids' favorite was hamburgers with fries.\newline\newlineOn days when it rained the children and parents would stay inside and read or color\newlinepictures and drink hot chocolate and they loved to wear big warm sweaters. At night the\newlinefamily would all go to the kitchen and cook dinner together and after dinner was finished\newlinethey would all clear the table and clean the dishes together before getting ready for\newlinebed. They would put their pajamas on but never wear socks and they would get under the\newlinecovers and fall asleep.	one: What were the kids favorite foods at the picnics?
