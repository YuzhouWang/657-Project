After looking, she saw her friend George by the\newlinebasketball hoop. George was playing all by himself. George was happy when he saw\newlineLaura. Laura and George played basketball they saw the ice cream man driving in his\newlinetruck. George asked Laura if she wanted him to buy her an ice cream cone. Laura said she\newlinewould like him to do that. Laura sat on the bench as George walked to the ice cream\newlinetruck. Laura looked in the sky and saw a pretty bird flying in a large circle. The bird\newlineflew away. George came back with two ice cream cones. One of the ice cream cones had\newlinerainbow sprinkles on it. George gave the ice cream cone with sprinkles to Laura. George and\newlineLaura sat on the bench and watched a group of boys play football as they ate their ice\newlinecream cones. One of the boys broke his leg. When George and Laura were finished with their\newlineice cream, Laura ran home before the street lights came on.	multiple: What sport was George playing by himself?	football	baseball	basketball	soccer	multiple: What did the bird do in the sky?	take a poop	eat a worm	fly in a circle then fly away	play with a cloud	multiple: What did Laura see as she ate the ice cream cone?	a boy break his leg	a mother yelling	a dog running	a car crash	multiple: Who got the ice cream cones?
