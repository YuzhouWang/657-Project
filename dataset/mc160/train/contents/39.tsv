mc160.train.39	Author: 1226214207;Work Time(s): 5602	Tommy's birthday is next week.  He is hoping for a very special gift.  What are some\newlinethings Tommy is hoping for?\newline\newlineHe would like a big, bouncy ball, like his friends Bobby and Joey have.  One with blue\newlinestripes!\newline\newlineHe would really like some new sneakers.  Danny, Tommy's best friend, got a special pair of\newlinesneakers for HIS birthday last month.  They have pictures of robots on them and even light\newlineup when you walk!\newline\newlineHe would really, REALLY like a shiny new bicycle.  Tommy has an old bicycle now. He is\newlinegetting too big for it.  He saw a red one in the store yesterday when he was shopping with\newlinehis Mom.  It looked like it was the right size for him!\newline\newlineBut what Tommy wants most of all is a new baby brother.  Today his Mom and Dad said that\newlinehe might have one very, very soon.  Then Tommy and his little brother can have many fun\newlinebirthdays together.  That would be the best gift of all!	multiple: What makes Danny's sneakers special?	bouncy	shiny red	pictures of robots	blue stripes	one: When is Tommy's birthday?	today	last month	yesterday	next week	multiple: What's wrong with Tommy's old bicycle?	it's not shiny	it's too small	it's old	it's red	one: Who is Tommy's best friend?
