One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the\newlineway out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and Freddy grabbed his\newlinehelmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told\newlinehim, "Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"  Freddy thought about\newlinewhat his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his\newlinehelmet.\newline\newlineFreddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of\newlinethe largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never\newlineridden down this hill before.  His friends said, "What are you, scared?"  Freddy did not\newlinewant to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started\newlinespeeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't\newlineworking.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of\newlinethe hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.\newline\newlineAt the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole\newlinestory.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his\newlinehelmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right\newlinein the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it's\newlineimportant to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool\newlinebecause you wear a helmet are the ones that aren't cool in the first place.	one: Who does Freddy love?
