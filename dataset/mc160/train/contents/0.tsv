mc160.train.0	Author: 1844466225;Work Time(s): 2383	Tom had to fix some things around the house. He had to fix the door. He had to fix the\newlinewindow. But before he did anything he had to fix the toilet. Tom called over his best\newlinefriend Jim to help him. Jim brought with him his friends Molly and Holly. Tom thought that\newlineJim was going to bring Dolly with him but he didn't. The four of them got to work right\newlineaway. Fixing the toilet was easy. Fixing the door was also easy but fixing the window was\newlinevery hard. The window was stuck and could not be opened. They all pushed on the window\newlinereally hard until finally it opened. Once the window was fixed the four of them made a\newlinedelicious dinner and talked about all of the good work that they had done. Tom was glad\newlinethat he had such good friends to help him with his work.	multiple: What was the hardest thing for Tom and his friends to fix?
