They throw the ball around.  They practice batting\newlineand they practice fielding.\newline\newlineTommy begins to see that James is getting better every day.  He says "I do not believe it,\newlineJames, but I think you are going to be pretty good when the season starts!"\newline\newlineUsually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but James is practicing\newlineso much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.\newline\newlineThen James has a setback.  His glove rips during practice.  He can't keep playing with a\newlinebroken glove!\newline\newlineSo Tommy and James go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for each\newlinebottle.\newline\newlineJames misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirty\newlinedollars.\newline\newlineThis is enough money for James to buy a new glove!\newline\newlineSo James buys a new glove and he and Tommy go back to the field and practice some\newlinemore.\newline\newlineBy the time the season comes James is one of the best players on his team.	multiple: How long does James have to play every day for a week to be good at baseball?	2 hours	1 hour	7 hours	5 hours	multiple: what does James do when his glove rips?	he gives up	he borrows his brother's glove	he looks for a way to make money	he gets mad and yells	one: What does James need to practice?	music	hockey	football	baseball	one: What is James' friend's name?
