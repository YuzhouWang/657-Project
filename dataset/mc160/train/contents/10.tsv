mc160.train.10	Author: 3801923153;Work Time(s): 1365	Jake wanted to eat an orange.  He liked fruit, and the only fruits in the house were\newlineapples, which he didn't like, oranges, and strawberries, which made him itchy.  But his\newlinemother had put oranges on top of the refrigerator.   Jake couldn't reach the top of the\newlinerefrigerator.  He got the stool that he used to reach things in the cupboards.   But the\newlinestool wasn't tall enough on its own.  He thought if he stood on the edge of the kitchen\newlinesink he could reach the oranges.  (The kitchen sink was right next to the refrigerator).\newlineSo he used the stool to get up to the edge of the sink, and then he stood on the edge of\newlinethe sink to get the oranges.  He took one out of the bag and then put the bag back on top\newlineof the refrigerator.  Then he used the stool to climb back down again with his orange.  He\newlinesat at the kitchen table, peeled the orange, and ate it.  Then he took all of the pieces\newlineof orange peel and threw them away in the yard waste.	multiple: Why doesn't using the stool work at first?
