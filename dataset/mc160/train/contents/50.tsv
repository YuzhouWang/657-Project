Tumble liked to walk around outside in the garden and dig small holes to sleep\newlinein.  Billy loved Tumble and would visit him outside when he got home from school.\newlineTumble's favorite food was oatmeal.  So, every day after school, Billy would make Tumble a\newlinebig bowl of oatmeal and take it outside for Tumble to enjoy.  Tumble would see Billy and\newlinewalk up to him as fast as a turtle can go.  Billy would put the bowl down and wait for\newlineTumble to come up to the bowl to eat from it. When Tumble reached the bowl, he put his\newlinenose on it.  But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat.  Billy reached down and blew on the hot\newlineoatmeal, to cool it down for Tumble to eat.  Once the oatmeal was cool enough, Tumble\newlinecould dig in and eat his big bowl of oatmeal.  Billy loved to watch as Tumble ate his bowl\newlineof oatmeal, because Billy took good care of Tumble, everyday.	multiple: Why couldn't Tumble eat his oatmeal, at first?
