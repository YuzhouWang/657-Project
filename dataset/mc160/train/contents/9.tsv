Pawn did not very much care for chess as\newlinehe was very bored with it. Another problem Pawn had was that he didn't like some of the\newlineother people in this land. They had names like Bishop, Queen, Rook, and Knight. And most\newlineof all, there was King. He was the greatest person in Board. One day, during their normal\newlinebattle, Pawn saw an opening to move to the far end of Board. He almost got hurt by Knight\newlinebut he got away. Amazingly, when he got to the other end he became as powerful as\newlineQueen. With this amazing power, Pawn chose to help keep King safe. All was well until Pawn\newlinewoke up and knew that it was only a dream. He was still Pawn.	one: Who almost hurt Pawn?	Pawn	Queen	King	Knight	multiple: Who was the greatest person in Board?
