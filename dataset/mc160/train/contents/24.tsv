Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in\newlineher old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.  Lauren picked Chocolate up to help\newlineher cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very\newlinefast.  After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head\newlineout of her shell and looked at the little girl.  Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate's\newlineshell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so\newlineLauren took the turtle home.  Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried\newlinethat her mother would be mad. Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left\newlineChocolate alone in the bathtub.  Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard\newlineher mother call out, "Lauren, get in here now!"  Lauren knew she was in trouble.  But when\newlineLauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  Lauren's mom told her that she had\newlinea turtle when she was a little girl.  Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal\newlinedoctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate's\newlineeyes.  Lauren put the drops in Chocolate's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the\newlineturtle's eyes were all better. Chocolate's shell was still old and worn looking, like an\newlineold shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on Grandma's earrings.\newlineLauren was glad that she helped Chocolate.	one: Who was Chocolate?	a cat	a dog	a lizard	a turtle	multiple: What did Chocolate have at the beginning and the end of the story?	a worn shell	beautiful golden eyes	bright green eyes	a shiny shell	one: Where did Lauren hide Chocolate?	in a closet	in a box	in her backpack	in the bathtub	multiple: What did Lauren do to help Chocolate?	fed her and put drops in her eyes	helped her cross the road and gave her a bath	helped her cross the road and put drops in her eyes	gave her a bath and fed her
