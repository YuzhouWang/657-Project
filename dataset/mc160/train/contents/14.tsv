Thomas had a nice dad named\newlineRick. Thomas and Rudy had been friends for almost a year. Rudy and Thomas loved to play in\newlinethe big back yard. Sometimes, Thomas would ask his friend Jacob to come to the back yard\newlineand play with them. Jacob would always bring his puppy too. Jacob's puppy was named\newlineSally. Thomas and  Jacob would run around the back yard and Rudy and Sally chased them and\newlinebarked. They all had so much fun playing together. One day, Thomas told Rudy that tomorrow\newlinewould be a very special day. It would be Rudy's birthday. Rudy was very excited. The next\newlineday came and Thomas threw a birthday party for Rudy. All of Rudy's friends were there and\newlinethey had presents for him. Jacob brought Rudy a new ball and Sally brought him a\newlinebone. There was one more present for Rudy to open. When he opened the gift from Thomas,\newlineRudy was so exited that he jumped and barked. It was a new red collar with a shiny name\newlinetag on it.
