Compared to his friends, he was very good at the\newlinesport. He didn't even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ball\newlineso hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!\newline\newlineHe was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy\newlinetricks like slam dunking (but he didn't really like all of the passes). He wasn't quite\newlinethat good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew\newlinethat if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.\newline\newlineFinally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn't play football\newlinehimself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands,\newlinecheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at\newlineall for the rest of the day.	multiple: Based on what John likes to do, what else do you think John would enjoy?
