We were enjoying our dinner\newlineat night when all of a sudden we heard a knock on the door. I opened the door and saw this\newlineguy who had scar on his face. I asked my friend "who is that guy?", and he told me that it\newlinewas his friend. I didn't trust that guy because he looked very strange.\newline\newlineAfter we had dinner the strange guy asked my friend to come outside because he wanted to\newlinetalk to him. A few seconds later I heard a noise from outside and when I ran outside I saw\newlinethat the strange guy was trying to beat my friend. I ran towards him and asked him to\newlineleave our house. He left the house but after half an hour he came back and this time he\newlinewas dressed up as superhero and he also had a sword. As soon as I saw him I ran inside the\newlinehouse and called the cops. The cops came and the guy ran away as soon as he heard the cop\newlinecar coming. We never found out what happened to that guy after that day.	one: What was the strange guy doing with the friend?	enjoying a meal	talking about his job	talking to him	trying to beat him	one: Why did the strange guy run away?	because he heard the cop car	because he saw his friend	because he didn't like the dinner	because it was getting late	one: Who was the strange guy dressed up as?	a sword	a car	a superhero	a cop	one: What did they eat at the friend's house?	lunch	snack	breakfast	dinner
