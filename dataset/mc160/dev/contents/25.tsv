mc160.dev.25	Author: 868073141;Work Time(s): 5062	Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really\newlinewanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked\newlineto blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.\newline\newlineHe had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a\newlineknight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good\newlinename for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  He\newlinepurred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret's\newlinemother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the\newlinebathroom and they clanked.\newline\newlineSo Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he\newlinestood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to get\newlineWolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He had\newlinea Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.	multiple: When did Wolfie purr?	when hogging the bathroom	when petted	when poked	when sleeping	multiple: What was the name of the cat?
