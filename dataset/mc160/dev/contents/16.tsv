If they get the right amount they win $100. If they get close they\newlineget a $20 gift card. The box looks like it is missing some gumballs. It turns out some\newlinepeople are eating them when they place their guess. 100 people guessed and took a piece of\newlinecandy. The box is 10" by 10" by 10". Each gumball is 1" each. Mike guessed 500. Jeff\newlineguessed 800. They both said they would split their money they win, if they win.	multiple: Who is closer?
