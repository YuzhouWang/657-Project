She had a big dream of becoming spelling bee\newlinewinner. Ana studied very hard to be the best she could be at spelling. Ana's best friend\newlinewould help her study every day after school. By the time the spelling bee arrived Ana and\newlineher best friend were sure she would win. There were ten students in the spelling bee. This\newlinemade Ana very nervous, but when she looked out and saw her dad cheering her on she knew\newlineshe could do it. The spelling bee had five rounds and Ana made it through them all. She\newlinewas now in the finals. During the final round James, the boy she was in the finals with, was\newlinegiven a really hard word and he spelled it wrong. All Ana had to do was spell this last\newlineword and she would be the winner. Ana stepped to the microphone, thought really hard and\newlinespelled the word. She waited and finally her teacher said "That is correct". Ana had won\newlinethe spelling bee. Ana was so happy. She won a trophy. Ana also won a big yellow\newlineribbon. The whole school was also happy, and everyone clapped for her. The whole school\newlinewent outside. They had a picnic to celebrate Ana winning.	multiple: What made Ana very nervous?
