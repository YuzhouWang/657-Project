One day she chose to leave but her mother would not let\newlineher. The princess climbed out the window of the high tower and climbed down the south wall\newlinewhen her mother was sleeping. She wandered out a good ways. Finally she went into the\newlineforest where there are no electric poles but where there are some caves.  There she met a\newlineyoung man who was running. His name was John. John asked the princess why such a beautiful\newlinewoman like her was out in the middle of a forest. She said that she had been trapped for\newlineher whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother. The man said that he would\newlinetake the princess to a castle that was near. He also said that he thought that she may be\newlinethe missing princess. As they go through the forest they run into many problems. They see\newlinethat they are lost and have no way of finding where to go. After several days pass, the\newlineprincess climbs up to the top of a tree in order to find out where they are. She sees that\newlinethe castle where they want to go is not that far away and near a mountain. After thinking\newlineof the best way to get there, John and the princess go to the castle where they live for\newlinethe rest of their lives.	multiple: Where did the princess wander to after escaping?
