They drew pictures in Hannah's notebook.  They snuck\newlineinto Hannah's mother's closet to try on her shoes, but Hannah's mother caught them.  She\newlinesaid, "You girls need something to do.  Let's take a walk to the park!" Hannah and Mary\newlinelooked at each other, and then jumped up and down happily.  "The park sounds great!" said\newlineHannah.  "Let's go!" cried Mary.  So Hannah's mother packed up a snack of apples and\newlinecookies, and they all set off to walk to the park.  They walked down the sidewalk, looking\newlineat all the interesting things along the way.  Mary spotted a squirrel.  Hannah saw a\newlineyellow bird.  Hannah's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front of\newlineMr. Smith's house.  When they got to the park, Hannah's mother spread out a picnic blanket\newlineand the snack.  Hannah and Mary ran around chasing butterflies for a little time, and then\newlinesat down to eat their snacks.  When they finished, Hannah's mother put the leftovers in a\newlinetrash can.  As they walked back home, Hannah thought that the boring day had turned out\newlinequite well.	one: What did Hannah and Mary chase at the park?	butterflies	turtles	birds	ducks	one: What did Hannah's mother do with the leftovers?	threw it on the ground	there was no trash	Put it in the trash can	took it home	multiple: What did Hannah and Mary see on their way to the park?
