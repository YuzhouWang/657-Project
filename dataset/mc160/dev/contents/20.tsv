mc160.dev.20	Author: 1091830255;Work Time(s): 1853	On a hot summer day, Brian was walking home from the park. While walking, Brian passed his\newlinefavorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.  Brian's\newlinebaseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  Brian really wanted the new\newlineglove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of the\newlinenew glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had\newlinesix dollars and fifty cents.  Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money.\newlineHe checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all of\newlinehis pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  Brian then went to\newlinelook between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three\newlinedollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not\newlinehave enough money to buy the new glove.  Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard\newlinework. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the\newlinemoney he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the\newlineafternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  Brian's dad was very proud that his son\newlinewas working hard for money. When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too\newlinelate, and the toy store was closed.  Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk\newlineup to home holding the new glove that he wanted.  Brian was so happy, and he and his dad\newlinespent the rest of the afternoon having a catch.	one: Why did Brian dad buy him the glove?	His dad wanted to him to practice.
