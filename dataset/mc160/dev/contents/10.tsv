Luna hoped that her friends could help her find some socks. She\newlineflew to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived.\newline\newline"Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" she asked.\newline\newlineOlive the owl looked surprised. "Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes\newlinehave thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might have\newlineextra socks you could borrow."\newline\newlineLuna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teaching\newlineher six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were having\newlinefun.\newline\newline"Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?"\newlinebegged Luna.\newline\newlineRose laughed hard. "Silly Luna, I do not have socks. Look at my legs and feet. They are\newlinecovered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. Sometimes\newlineI tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair of\newlinesocks."\newline\newlineLuna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She\newlinewas told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it was\newlinedifficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the big\newlinehill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In late\newlineautumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring\newlinein one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden\newlinepins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew\newlineback to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. Luna was\newlinevery happy.	one: Why did Olive the owl not have any socks?	She had given her socks to another friend.
