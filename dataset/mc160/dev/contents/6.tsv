mc160.dev.6	Author: 1006609625;Work Time(s): 2342	Roger was a grasshopper. He loved to hop. He hopped everywhere by himself. One day when he\newlinewas hopping around he bumped into a frog sitting on a log. The frog told him his name was\newlineGilbert. Gilbert told Roger that it had been a long time since he bumped into\newlineanybody. Roger told him that since both grasshoppers and frogs like to jump they would\newlinemake great friends. The next day they were hopping through a field and they saw something\newlinevery strange.  In a pond they saw a spider floating on a lily pad. The spider was very sad\newlinebecause he did not have any friends. Roger and Gilbert asked him why he didn't have any\newlinefriends. The spider told them that everybody would scream and run away when they saw him.\newlineRoger and Gilbert told him that he didn't look scary to them and that he could come along\newlinewith them if he wanted. So Sam the spider said yes, and the three of them began a life\newlinetime friendship full of adventures.	multiple: What did Roger like to do?	Bump.	Hop.	Swim.
