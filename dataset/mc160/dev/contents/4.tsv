We've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools.  This year my\newlineparents wanted to do something different.  They wanted to take us all to Elk River Castle.\newline\newlineAfter lots of planning we hit the road for our trip.  My Brother Kelsey and I enjoyed the\newlinelong car ride there.\newline  \newlineOnce we arrive, the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined.  There was so much to\newlinesee and so much to do.  There was a swimming pool, movie theater and an elevator to take\newlineus from floor to floor.  What a magical place!  I was so excited because we had the whole\newlineplace to our family!\newline  \newlineWe spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places.\newlineThere was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets.  My brother, Kelsey, and I\newlineplayed hide and go seek for hours, watched movies and swam until the sun went down.\newline\newlineIt was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories.\newlineWe'll never forget our trip to Elk River Castle!	one: What was my brother's name?
