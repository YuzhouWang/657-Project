mc160.dev.9	Author: 2311321761;Work Time(s): 634	Peter was a very sad puppy.  He had been inside of the pet store for a very long time.  In\newlinefact, he had been there for three months!  Peter had seen many other puppies find a\newlineperson; he began to wonder why he could not get one.  He thought that maybe his fur was\newlinenot pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough.  He tried and tried to please\newlineevery person who came to the store, but they all picked smaller puppies.  However, one day\newlineall of this changed.  Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy.  She wanted a\newlinepuppy she could snuggle with.  It so happened that Peter was very sad and tired that day.\newlineSammie came to hold him.  Peter wanted to show off his bark, but he was too tired.  He\newlinefell right to sleep.  Sammie loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms.  Sammie\newlinetook Peter home that day, and they made lots of fun memories.	multiple: What did Peter want to do when Sammie came?
