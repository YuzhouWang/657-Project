mc160.dev.23	Author: 3048636168;Work Time(s): 1252	One day Magneson took a walk in the park.  He passed some trees and a pond.  In the pond\newlinewas a duck named George.  George's wife was also in the pond.  Her name was Nancy.\newline\newlineMagneson walked over to the tree.  Nancy flew up into the tree.  She wanted to warn\newlineMagneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.  A few years before, the\newlinesquirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy's son.  He was knocked out, and the\newlinesquirrel took him away.  He was never seen again.\newline\newlineMagneson asked what their son's name was.  They said it was Leonard.  But Magneson was\newlineonly making small talk.  He didn't believe the story about the killer squirrel.  Even if\newlinethere was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.  He\newlinecould also hide in the tall grass.\newline\newlineGeorge and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn't listen.  They flew away, singing\newlinea sad song.  A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant\newlinewalnut at Magneson.  No one ever saw Magneson again.	multiple: What was George's wife's name?
