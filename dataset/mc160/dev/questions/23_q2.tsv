One day @entity1 took a walk in the park.  He passed some trees and a pond.  In the pondwas a duck named @entity3.  @entity3's wife was also in the pond.  Her name was @entity4.@entity1 walked over to the tree.  @entity4 flew up into the tree.  She wanted to warn@entity1 about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.  A few years before, thesquirrel had thrown a chestnut at @entity3 and @entity4's son.  He was knocked out, and thesquirrel took him away.  He was never seen again.@entity1 asked what their son's name was.  They said it was @entity2.  But @entity1 wasonly making small talk.  He did not believe the story about the killer squirrel.  Even ifthere was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.  @entity0 also hide in the tall grass.@entity3 and @entity4 were sorry to see that @entity1 would not listen.  They flew away, singinga sad song.  A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giantwalnut at @entity1.  No one ever saw @entity1 again.
