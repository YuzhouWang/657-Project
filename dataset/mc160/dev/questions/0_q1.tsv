It was @entity1 Bear's birthday. She was having a party.  She asked her two best friends to come to the party.  She made a big cake, and hung up some balloons. Soon her friend @entity2 came over. Then her friend @entity0 came over. @entity2 and @entity0 brought presents with them. @entity1 hugged her friends. She asked them if they would like to have cake.  Yes! said @entity2. Yes yes! said @entity0. @entity1 cut the cake, and they all ate it together. Then @entity1 opened her presents. She got a new jump rope and a fun game.  She asked @entity2 and @entity0 to play the game with her. The friends played and played. They all had a good time. Soon it was time for the party to be over. @entity2 and @entity0 hugged @entity1 and said goodbye to her.  Thanks for a great birthday! @entity1 Bear told her two best friends.
