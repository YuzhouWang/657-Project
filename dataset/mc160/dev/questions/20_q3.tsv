On a hot summer day, @entity0 was walking home from the park. While walking, @entity0 passed hisfavorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.  @entity0'sbaseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  @entity0 really wanted the newglove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of thenew glove was fifteen dollars, but when @entity0 checked his pockets for money, he only hadsix dollars and fifty cents.  @entity0 ran home and went to look around his house for money.He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all ofhis pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  @entity0 then went tolook between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another threedollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, @entity0 knew that he still did nothave enough money to buy the new glove.  @entity0 went outside and saw his dad doing yardwork. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have themoney he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so @entity0 spent the rest of theafternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  @entity0's dad was very proud that his sonwas working hard for money. When @entity0 was finally done, @entity0 knew that he was toolate, and the toy store was closed.  Just as @entity0 was walking inside, he saw his dad walkup to home holding the new glove that he wanted.  @entity0 was so happy, and he and his dadspent the rest of the afternoon having a catch.
