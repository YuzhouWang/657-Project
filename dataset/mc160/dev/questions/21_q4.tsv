On a nice and sunny day, @entity0 and @entity1 walked to the beach. When they got there, the first thing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure. To find the treasure they had brought two shovels and two buckets. They both started digging holes in the sand with their shovels. After looking very hard for treasure for an hour, they did not find anything. This made @entity0 and @entity1 very sad. They gave up and went to play in the water. While they were playing in the water, @entity1 found a bottle with a little paper inside. @entity1 opened the bottle and found a treasure map. @entity1 showed the map to @entity0 and they started to look for the treasure.  After walking every step that the map said, they started digging with their shovels. After digging a really a big hole, they found a box. They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside. @entity0 slowly opened the box and there was a very big pearl.  Next, they ran to a special store to ask about the pearl. The worker in the store told @entity0 and @entity1 that the pearl could make them rich. @entity0 and @entity1 looked at each other and decided not to sell it. They took the pearl home and saved it in a special box, so they could remember their day at the beach.
