Once upon a time, there was a dog named @entity0. @entity0 was lonely because he lived in anarea where there were no other dogs, but only cats. Day after day, @entity0 would have toeat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found itvery boring and @entity0 was sad. @entity0 did not even look like a cat!All of the other cats teased @entity0. "You're too big," they said. "You've got too long ofa nose!" "Why are you panting like that?" @entity0 knew that he was different.One day, @entity0 chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What astupid dog! Did not he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him?@entity0 did not care, because @entity0 was sad enough to try.So @entity0 packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - andheaded off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, @entity0 turned. Hesmelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turnedaround, and what did he see but another dog!@entity0 was so happy, he barked with joy. He went home with the other dog, who was namedMittens, and to his family. @entity0 was never lonely again.
