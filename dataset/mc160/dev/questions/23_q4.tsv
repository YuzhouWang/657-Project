One day @entity0 took a walk in the park.  He passed some trees and a pond.  In the pond was a duck named @entity2.  @entity2's wife was also in the pond.  Her name was @entity3. @entity0 walked over to the tree.  @entity3 flew up into the tree.  She wanted to warn @entity0 about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.  A few years before, the squirrel had thrown a chestnut at @entity2 and @entity3's son.  He was knocked out, and the squirrel took him away.  He was never seen again. @entity0 asked what their son's name was.  They said it was @entity1.  But @entity0 was only making small talk.  He did not believe the story about the killer squirrel.  Even if there was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.  He could also hide in the tall grass. @entity2 and @entity3 were sorry to see that @entity0 would not listen.  They flew away, singing a sad song.  A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at @entity0.  No one ever saw @entity0 again.
