On a hot summer day, @entity0 was walking home from the park. While walking, @entity0 passed his favorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.  @entity0's baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  @entity0 really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when @entity0 checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.  @entity0 ran home and went to look around his house for money. He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  @entity0 then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, @entity0 knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.  @entity0 went outside and saw his dad doing yard work. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so @entity0 spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  @entity0's dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money. When @entity0 was finally done, @entity0 knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.  Just as @entity0 was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.  @entity0 was so happy, and he and his dad spent the rest of the afternoon having a catch.
