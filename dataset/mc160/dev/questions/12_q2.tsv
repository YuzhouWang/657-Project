Three little kids lived in a great big house with a great big cat and many places for a great big cat to hide.  Their great big cat was named @entity0.  And @entity0 was not a very nice cat.  @entity0 liked to bite and chew and scratch a great many things.  When @entity0 was happy, which was not very often, @entity0 liked to bite in to a blanket or soft toy and carry it around in his mouth.  When @entity0 was hungry he liked to bite bright red tomatoes and suck out all the juice and seeds.  And when @entity0 was feeling mean he liked to hide. @entity0 would hide, curled up tight in a ball under a blanket or behind a corner and wait for one of the little kids to pass by.  When they did pass by @entity0 would jump at their feet and try to bite and scratch them.  He did not know that what he was doing was not very nice.  @entity0 was only a cat.  A great big cat that did not know any better.
