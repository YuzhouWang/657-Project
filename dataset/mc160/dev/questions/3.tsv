@entity0 ran to the corner with her older brother @entity1.  He had money for the ice cream truckin his pocket and she was very happy. The ice cream truck had been parked at the curbwaiting for children for a very long time.  The ice cream truck driver thought that nomore children were coming to get ice cream so he started pulling away from the curb whenthey got to the corner. They yelled.  They screamed, "@entity2! @entity2!" and jumped up and downon the side walk trying to get him to see them. The driver of the truck saw them, waved atthem and smiled, pulled back to the curb and opened his truck up so that they could seeeverything that he had for sale.  They were so excited. They saw some new treats. @entity1wanted to try something new. He got an ice cream sundae with chocolate ice cream andnuts. He almost got a snow cone. @entity0 looked at everything that the ice cream truckhad. She saw candy, ice cream cones, snow cones, and everything else. It all looked sogood. But after looking at everything, she wanted to get an ice cream sandwich. She gotthe ice cream sandwich. She bit into it and smiled. It tasted so good. She felt sohappy. Her brother, @entity1, was happy too. He bit into his ice cream cone sundae andgrinned.
