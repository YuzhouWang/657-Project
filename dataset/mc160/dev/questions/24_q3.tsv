Every Monday morning, the little bad boy named @entity1 goes to school.Suddenly, little @entity1 slips on a banana skin ...- Ouch, says @entity1, I fell on this and in addition I got a bump on the forehead!- Wonderful! said the banana peel. I am @entity0. I turned into banana skin after throwing trash on the school yard. You have saved me and now I'm back to good old @entity0. What's your name?- @entity2 is @entity1... I'm a late to class ... are you serious, where is the banana peel anyways?- The @entity4, my dear @entity1, was eaten by me, I threw the banana peel and turned into one ... now you saved me, can you see the banana peel you slipped on around here?- No, you are right.- @entity0 said:  @entity1, @entity3 you- Excuse me, @entity0 ... I have to go ... Otherwise I'll be late for school ... And I would not want to upset the teacher.
