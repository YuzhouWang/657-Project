My parents, @entity3 and @entity4, said that it was that time of year to take a familyvacation.  We've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools.  This year myparents wanted to do something different.  They wanted to take us all to @entity2.After lots of planning we hit the road for our trip.  My Brother @entity0 and I enjoyed thelong car ride there.  Once we arrive, the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined.  There was so much tosee and so much to do.  There was a swimming pool, movie theater and an elevator to takeus from floor to floor.  What a magical place!  I was so excited because we had the wholeplace to our family!  We spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places.There was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets.  My brother, @entity0, and @entity1 hide and go seek for hours, watched movies and swam until the sun went down.It was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories.We'll never forget our trip to @entity2!
