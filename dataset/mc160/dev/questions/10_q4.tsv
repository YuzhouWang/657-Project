@entity1 the hawk wanted some socks. It was the middle of winter and sitting on tree branchesmade her feet very cold. @entity1 hoped that her friends could help her find some socks. @entity4 to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived."Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" she asked.Olive the owl looked surprised. "@entity1, I have no use for socks because my legs and toeshave thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might haveextra socks you could borrow."@entity1 flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teachingher six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were havingfun."Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?"begged @entity1.Rose laughed hard. "Silly @entity1, I do not have socks. @entity3 at my legs and feet. They arecovered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. @entity0 tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair ofsocks."@entity1 was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. @entity2 told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it wasdifficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the bighill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In lateautumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bringin one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two woodenpins. @entity1 used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flewback to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. @entity1 wasvery happy.

@placeholder could the baby raccoons play in the icy creek without hurting their paws

because their legs and feet have a thick covering of fur that keeps them warm.
