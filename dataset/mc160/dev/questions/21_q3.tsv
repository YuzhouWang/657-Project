On a nice and sunny day, @entity0 and @entity1 walked to the beach. When they got there, the firstthing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure. To find the treasure they hadbrought two shovels and two buckets. They both started digging holes in the sand withtheir shovels. After looking very hard for treasure for an hour, they did not findanything. This made @entity0 and @entity1 very sad. They gave up and went to play in thewater. While they were playing in the water, @entity1 found a bottle with a little paperinside. @entity1 opened the bottle and found a treasure map. @entity1 showed the map to @entity0 andthey started to look for the treasure.  After walking every step that the map said, theystarted digging with their shovels. After digging a really a big hole, they found abox. They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside. @entity0 slowlyopened the box and there was a very big pearl.  Next, they ran to a special store to askabout the pearl. The worker in the store told @entity0 and @entity1 that the pearl could make themrich. @entity0 and @entity1 looked at each other and decided not to sell it. They took the pearlhome and saved it in a special box, so they could remember their day at the beach.
