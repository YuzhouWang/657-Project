@entity1 was a very sad puppy.  He had been inside of the pet store for a very long time.  @entity2, he had been there for three months!  @entity1 had seen many other puppies find aperson; he began to wonder why he could not get one.  He thought that maybe his fur wasnot pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough.  He tried and tried to pleaseevery person who came to the store, but they all picked smaller puppies.  However, one dayall of this changed.  @entity3 came into the store looking for a golden puppy.  She wanted apuppy she could snuggle with.  It so happened that @entity1 was very sad and tired that day.@entity3 came to hold him.  @entity1 wanted to show off his bark, but he was too tired.  @entity0 right to sleep.  @entity3 loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms.  @entity3took @entity1 home that day, and they made lots of fun memories.
