@entity0 lived in a town outside the city . Unlike the city the town was peaceful and quietand full of trees, flowers and animals.  One day his dad came in from work and said "Comeon, son, I'm going to take you to the city." @entity0 was very exited so he put on his shoesand ran to the car.  When they got to the city @entity0 was very surprised there were so manycars and people, everyone seemed to be in a hurry. There were no trees, no flowers, and noanimals. @entity0 was so happy to get back home.  When his mom asked him about his trip to thecity @entity0 said,"There's no place like home."

@placeholder did @entity0 say when he got home from the city
