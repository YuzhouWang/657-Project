This is a story about a bear and a wolf. The bear met the wolf one day in the woods. @entity0 said to the wolf, would you like to go to the river with me? The wolf said yes, hewould like to go to the river. When the bear and the wolf got to the river they found thata beaver had built a bridge to the other side of the river. The bear and the wolf crossedthe bridge that was built by the beaver and found that they were now in a part of thewoods they had never seen before. A little worried that they may get lost in this part ofthe woods they had never seen before the bear and the wolf turned around. They went backover the bridge and were happy to be back in a part of the woods they knew so well. Thebeaver thanked both the bear and the wolf for trying out his new bridge and then startedto build yet another bridge close to the first bridge. He was a very busy beaver.
