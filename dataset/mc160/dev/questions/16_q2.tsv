@entity1 and @entity4 are close friends. Their school is having a guessing game to guess how many gumballs are in a box. If they get the right amount they win $One @entity0. If they get close they get a $Twenty gift card. The box looks like it is missing some gumballs. It turns out some people are eating them when they place their guess. One @entity0 people guessed and took a piece of candy. The box is @entity3" by @entity3" by @entity3". Each gumball is One" each. @entity1 guessed Five @entity0. @entity4 guessed @entity2 @entity0. They both said they would split their money they win, if they win.
