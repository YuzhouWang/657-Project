Once there was a young boy named @entity2 who had a cat named @entity1.  The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat @entity0. He had also thought about naming his cat @entity3.  @entity2 himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought @entity3 sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that @entity0 did not purr a lot.  He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus @entity2's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked. So @entity2 was left with a cat named @entity1.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "@entity0!  Here @entity0!!!", to get @entity1 to come in for the night.  But @entity2 did not care what anyone else thought.  He had a @entity0 and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.
