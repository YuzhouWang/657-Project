I'm here to tell you the story of a robot named @entity2. He came from a far away land known as @entity1. @entity2 was sad because he was missing a part called a tire. He also needed a sun gatherer. But, the tire was more important. Once @entity2 got all these parts he could travel to his new home in the nation of @entity3 and the city of Office. It was a tricky thing to get there with missing parts. Just as he had given up hope @entity2 got a message from @entity0 X saying the new parts were ready to be delivered. This made the robot very happy. The parts arrived a few days later and @entity2 put them in with Two days of work. After this @entity2 began to travel the last bit of his goal to get to his new job. After this @entity2 took Ten days to get to @entity3.
