@entity0 and her friend @entity1 were bored.  They sat around the house and tried to think about what to do.  They petted the cat.  They drew pictures in @entity0's notebook.  They snuck into @entity0's mother's closet to try on her shoes, but @entity0's mother caught them.  She said, "You girls need something to do.  Let's take a walk to the park!" @entity0 and @entity1 looked at each other, and then jumped up and down happily.  "The park sounds great!" said @entity0.  "Let's go!" cried @entity1.  So @entity0's mother packed up a snack of apples and cookies, and they all set off to walk to the park.  They walked down the sidewalk, looking at all the interesting things along the way.  @entity1 spotted a squirrel.  @entity0 saw a yellow bird.  @entity0's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front of @entity2's house.  When they got to the park, @entity0's mother spread out a picnic blanket and the snack.  @entity0 and @entity1 ran around chasing butterflies for a little time, and then sat down to eat their snacks.  When they finished, @entity0's mother put the leftovers in a trash can.  As they walked back home, @entity0 thought that the boring day had turned out quite well.
