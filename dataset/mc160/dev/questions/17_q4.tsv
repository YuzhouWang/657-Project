@entity0 and her friend @entity3 were bored.  They sat around the house and tried to think aboutwhat to do.  They petted the cat.  They drew pictures in @entity0's notebook.  They snuckinto @entity0's mother's closet to try on her shoes, but @entity0's mother caught them.  @entity4, "You girls need something to do.  Let's take a walk to the park!" @entity0 and @entity2 at each other, and then jumped up and down happily.  "The park sounds great!" said@entity0.  "Let's go!" cried @entity3.  So @entity0's mother packed up a snack of apples andcookies, and they all set off to walk to the park.  They walked down the sidewalk, lookingat all the interesting things along the way.  @entity3 spotted a squirrel.  @entity0 saw ayellow bird.  @entity0's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front ofMr. @entity1's house.  When they got to the park, @entity0's mother spread out a picnic blanketand the snack.  @entity0 and @entity3 ran around chasing butterflies for a little time, and thensat down to eat their snacks.  When they finished, @entity0's mother put the leftovers in atrash can.  As they walked back home, @entity0 thought that the boring day had turned outquite well.
