@entity1 was a grasshopper. He loved to hop. He hopped everywhere by himself. One day when hewas hopping around he bumped into a frog sitting on a log. The frog told him his name was@entity0. @entity0 told @entity1 that it had been a long time since he bumped intoanybody. @entity1 told him that since both grasshoppers and frogs like to jump they wouldmake great friends. The next day they were hopping through a field and they saw somethingvery strange.  In a pond they saw a spider floating on a lily pad. The spider was very sadbecause he did not have any friends. @entity1 and @entity0 asked him why he did not have anyfriends. The spider told them that everybody would scream and run away when they saw him.@entity1 and @entity0 told him that he did not look scary to them and that he could come alongwith them if he wanted. So Sam the spider said yes, and the three of them began a lifetime friendship full of adventures.
