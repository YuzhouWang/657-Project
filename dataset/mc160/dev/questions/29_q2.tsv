The princess climbed out the window of the high tower and climbed down the south wallwhen her mother was sleeping. She wandered out a good ways. Finally she went into theforest where there are no electric poles but where there are some caves.  There she met ayoung man who was running. His name was @entity0. @entity0 asked the princess why such a beautifulwoman like her was out in the middle of a forest. She said that she had been trapped forher whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother. The man said that he wouldtake the princess to a castle that was near. He also said that he thought that she may bethe missing princess. As they go through the forest they run into many problems. They seethat they are lost and have no way of finding where to go.
