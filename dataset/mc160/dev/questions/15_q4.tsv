@entity2's family lived in a small apartment in @entity0.  One day @entity2 came home from school and her mom told her that the family was moving to @entity1.  @entity2 was sad to leave her friends. @entity2 was sad to leave her school.  @entity2 helped her mom pack boxes and clean their apartment to get ready for the move.  Soon the day came when @entity2's dad brought a large truck to the parking lot and all of the family's things were put inside.  @entity2 and her mom rode in their car and her dad drove the truck towards @entity1.  @entity2 loved getting to eat lots of yummy fast food on the way.  When the family got to their new home in @entity1, @entity2 helped her parents to take all of the boxes into the house.  She loved her new bedroom!  When @entity2 was emptying box of her toys, there was a knock at the door.  It was a little girl who wanted @entity2 to play! @entity2 was going to like @entity1!
