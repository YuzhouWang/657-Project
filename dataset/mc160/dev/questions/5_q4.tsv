Once upon a time there a little girl named @entity1. @entity1 was a smart girl. Everyone in @entity1's school knew and liked her very much. She had a big dream of becoming spelling bee winner. @entity1 studied very hard to be the best she could be at spelling. @entity1's best friend would help her study every day after school. By the time the spelling bee arrived @entity1 and her best friend were sure she would win. There were ten students in the spelling bee. This made @entity1 very nervous, but when she looked out and saw her dad cheering her on she knew she could do it. The spelling bee had five rounds and @entity1 made it through them all. She was now in the finals. During the final round @entity0, the boy she was in the finals with, was given a really hard word and he spelled it wrong. All @entity1 had to do was spell this last word and she would be the winner. @entity1 stepped to the microphone, thought really hard and spelled the word. She waited and finally her teacher said "That is correct". @entity1 had won the spelling bee. @entity1 was so happy. She won a trophy. @entity1 also won a big yellow ribbon. The whole school was also happy, and everyone clapped for her. The whole school went outside. They had a picnic to celebrate @entity1 winning.
