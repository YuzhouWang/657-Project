I'm here to tell you the story of a robot named @entity2. He came from a far away land known @entity0. @entity2 was sad because he was missing a part called a tire. He also needed a sungatherer. But, the tire was more important. Once @entity2 got all these parts he could travelto his new home in the nation of @entity1 and the city of Office. It was a tricky thing to getthere with missing parts. Just as he had given up hope @entity2 got a message from Mr. Xsaying the new parts were ready to be delivered. This made the robot very happy. The partsarrived a few days later and @entity2 put them in with Two days of work. After this @entity2 beganto travel the last bit of his goal to get to his new job. After this @entity2 took Ten days toget to @entity1.
