@entity0 wanted to play on a baseball team. She had never tried to swing a bat and hit abaseball before. Her Dad gave her a bat and together they went to the park topractice. @entity0 wondered if she could hit a ball. She was not sure if she would be anygood. She really wanted to play on a team and wear a real uniform. She could not wait toget to the park and test out her bat. When @entity0 and her Dad reached the park, @entity0 grabbedthe bat and stood a few steps away from her Dad. @entity0 waited as her Dad pitched the ballto her. Her heart was beating fast. She missed the first few pitches. She felt likequitting but kept trying. Soon she was hitting the ball very far. She was very happy andshe could not wait to sign up for a real team. Her Dad was very proud of her for not givingup.
