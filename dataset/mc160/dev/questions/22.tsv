It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pullingweeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake sosometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and itmakes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming inor near the lake.On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my gardenand walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talkingin a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all ofthe time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" toother lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried andshort. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this soundwas not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spotanything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totallygiven up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was itcoming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around tothe other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it isnot a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a fatherlake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eatfish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby toswim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt veryspecial that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun thangardening.
