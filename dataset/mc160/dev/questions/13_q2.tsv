On the first day of school, Mrs. Law asked all the students to write a story telling her what they did over the summer. She told the students that they were going to read them in front of the class. This was going to help everyone get to know more about each other. When all the students were done writing their stories, @entity0 raised her hand to read hers first. Mrs. Law smiled at @entity0's excitement to share her story with the class. She told all the students to sit down and listen to @entity0. @entity0 started reading her story. All the other students quickly paid attention, as her story was telling about her vacation to a park with lots of rides. @entity0 told them that she rode a huge ride called, "Superman," which was her favorite. After @entity0 finished reading her story, all the students clapped and said that they wished that they could hear more. @entity0 told them to tell their mommies and daddies to take them to visit the rides next summer.
