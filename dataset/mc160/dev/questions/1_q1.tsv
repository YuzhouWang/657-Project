@entity0 had a very exciting summer vacation. She went to summer camp for the first time. She made friends with a girl named @entity1. They shared a bunk bed in their cabin. @entity0's favorite activity was walking in the woods because she enjoyed nature. @entity1 liked arts and crafts. Together, they made some art using leaves they found in the woods. Even after she fell in the water, @entity0 still enjoyed canoeing. She was sad when the camp was over, but promised to keep in touch with her new friend. @entity0 went to the beach with her family in the summer as well. She loves the beach. @entity0 collected shells and mailed some to her friend, @entity1, so she could make some arts and crafts with them. @entity0 liked fishing with her brothers, cooking on the grill with her dad, and swimming in the ocean with her mother. The summer was fun, but @entity0 was very excited to go back to school. She missed her friends and teachers. She was excited to tell them about her summer vacation.
