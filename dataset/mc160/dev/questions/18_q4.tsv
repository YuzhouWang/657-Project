@entity4 loves to play soccer. He plays for the @entity11. He is very good.  He was excited about the big game with the @entity7.  The night before the game, he went to bed late.  He was watching three TV shows that night.  First, was Muffins the Cat.  The second show was Ernie the Talking @entity0.  The third was Laughing with @entity10.  His @entity8 told him to go to bed, but @entity4 did not listen.  He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed all night.  First about sheep jumping fences.  Second about playing fetch the ball with @entity6. Third about Ernie the talking @entity0 kicking a soccer ball over the moon. @entity1 about his favorite soccer player, @entity9, head the ball in the goal. Finally, the next morning, @entity4 got up late because he was so tired.  His @entity8 called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get @entity4 up, his @entity8 got @entity6 the dog to lick him in the face.  @entity4 got up but had to eat breakfast fast.  Then he quickly dressed into his uniform.  He was yawning. His @entity8 drove him to the soccer field.  The game had started.  @entity4 had to sit out the first quarter.  His team was losing one to nothing when @entity2 scored for the @entity7. @entity4 started the second quarter.  He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team.  The coach was surprised that @entity4 was so slow.  Usually he was fast.  After the second quarter, the @entity11 were losing two to one after @entity2 scored again for the @entity7 and @entity3 scored a goal for the @entity11. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, @entity4 fell asleep.  The third quarter started. @entity4 was snoring when the coach told him to go in.  When he saw @entity4 was sleeping, he sent @entity5 into the game.  @entity5 scored one goal and the @entity11 had tied the game two to two.  @entity6 the dog started barking and then licking @entity4 in the face.  @entity4 got up and stretched.  He was finally well rested.  The coach saw @entity4 and sent him into the game.  @entity4 remembered his dream.  In the last second, he headed the ball in the goal like @entity9. He won the game. The team cheered. Since that time, @entity4 goes to bed on time.  He always wants to be well rested.  His @entity8 was right.  He gave her a hug.
