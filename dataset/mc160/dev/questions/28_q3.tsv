Once upon a time, there was a dog named @entity0. @entity0 was lonely because he lived in an area where there were no other dogs, but only cats. Day after day, @entity0 would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it very boring and @entity0 was sad. @entity0 did not even look like a cat! All of the other cats teased @entity0. "You're too big," they said. "You've got too long of a nose!" "Why are you panting like that?" @entity0 knew that he was different. One day, @entity0 chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a stupid dog! Did not he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him? @entity0 did not care, because @entity0 was sad enough to try. So @entity0 packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, @entity0 turned. He smelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned around, and what did he see but another dog! @entity0 was so happy, he barked with joy. He went home with the other dog, who was named @entity1, and to his family. @entity0 was never lonely again.
