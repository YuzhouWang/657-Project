Once upon a time there a little girl named @entity1. @entity1 was a smart girl. Everyone in @entity1'sschool knew and liked her very much. She had a big dream of becoming spelling beewinner. @entity1 studied very hard to be the best she could be at spelling. @entity1's best friendwould help her study every day after school. By the time the spelling bee arrived @entity1 andher best friend were sure she would win. There were ten students in the spelling bee. Thismade @entity1 very nervous, but when she looked out and saw her dad cheering her on she knewshe could do it. The spelling bee had five rounds and @entity1 made it through them all. Shewas now in the finals. During the final round @entity0, the boy she was in the finals with, wasgiven a really hard word and he spelled it wrong. All @entity1 had to do was spell this lastword and she would be the winner. @entity1 stepped to the microphone, thought really hard andspelled the word. She waited and finally her teacher said "That is correct". @entity1 had wonthe spelling bee. @entity1 was so happy. She won a trophy. @entity1 also won a big yellowribbon. The whole school was also happy, and everyone clapped for her. The whole schoolwent outside. They had a picnic to celebrate @entity1 winning.
