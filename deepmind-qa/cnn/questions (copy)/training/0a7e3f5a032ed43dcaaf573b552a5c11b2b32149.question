as the former director of communications at the @entity3 , crisis management guru @entity0 whips her clients into shape . and she looks good while doing it . so good , in fact , that there are countless blogs dedicated to the " scandal " character 's chic , business casual attire . using dainty jewelry , a pastel color palette and perfectly tailored separates , costume designer @entity14 said her plan for @entity19 , played by actress @entity20 , was to " create a vision of femininity , but still show strength . " @entity19 's wardrobe will look more or less the same when the @entity27 series ' second season premieres on september 27 , @entity25 said . but possibly not for long . " what we 're doing with ( @entity19 ) works , and it 's a theme that we 'll stay with ; however , because of things i ca n't tell you , we may change slightly , " she teased . " there are certain tonal things that i 'm doing at the moment to express the differences in ( the characters ' ) lives . specifically with the @entity44 ( @entity43 ) character and @entity47 ( @entity46 ) character . " whether @entity44 's secret identity will influence her wardrobe remains to be seen . and who knows what 's in store for @entity47 , a former @entity53 operative with a dark past . @entity56 fashion : outfitting ' @entity57 ' either way , this wo n't be the first time @entity25 has played with color and texture to evoke a certain tone . she said @entity19 dons cashmere and silk when she 's at home because she 's more vulnerable , and she often wears darker colors during flashbacks to show that she was a different person back then . as a costume designer , @entity25 says her job is to " create another human . if you 're really doing your job , you 're making it easy for an actor to inhabit that person 's skin . ... they can walk into their trailer in the morning , don the costume and all of a sudden , they become that other person . " in her more than 20 years as a costume designer , @entity25 has worked on " @entity86 " and " @entity87 , " as well as " @entity88 , " which might explain her knack for picking out a good power suit . @entity56 fashion : outfitting ' revenge ' it 's all about knowing what works on an actor 's body , @entity25 said , adding , " if you look at ( @entity19 ) you 'll see her silhouettes are fairly consistent . ... it 's a classic business look , " with a feminine twist , of course . " this woman is working in a very complicated , lets face it , male - oriented world in @entity107 , " the costume designer said of the series , which is filmed in @entity103 . " when you talk about @entity107 , you think of dark gray and navy blue . look at a picture of @entity112 . everyone pretty much looks the same . ... my idea was , we should always have @entity0 standout in some way . " but while @entity19 is standing out , her accessories are blending in . " we always want to find something that embellishes the costume , but also disappears , " @entity25 said . " it should n't be jarring . we tend to do a lot of tone - on - tone -- neutrals or pinks . " and that goes for her shoes , as well . " i do n't want them to draw attention , " @entity25 said , adding , they almost look like paint chips lined up in her closet -- " one tone of gray after another . " @entity19 will continue sporting " the long necklaces that are in vogue right now , " @entity25 said , adding , she 'll also have a new @entity143 purse and two new @entity144 watches , one in rose gold and one in silver , in addition to the gold timepiece she wore during season one . @entity107 's character only wears @entity144 watches for the same reason she typically carries one of four classic @entity143 purses . " we wanted her to have a watch that was functional and spoke to who she is , but was n't a distraction . ... elegant and understated , " @entity25 said . " @entity19 is always focused on the job ahead . " she 'll don her standard @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 threads -- on loan from the designers -- mixed with pieces @entity25 finds at stores such as @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 's . " we get top of the line stuff , but the thing that makes our show so good is the tailoring , " @entity25 said . " we have an army of tailors who take everything in and make it fit properly . " @entity107 is so petite that @entity25 's team sometimes spends up to 40 minutes pinning a jacket before even cutting it , which can take an additional three to four hours . but that 's not the case for every actor , @entity25 said . @entity189 , who plays @entity190 on the series , fits into a suit right off the rack . " you do n't want more than one set of hands on a piece of beautiful clothing , " @entity25 said . " it 's like drawing or sketching . you ca n't hand it off to someone else . " to achieve @entity19 's business casual look , @entity25 suggests women look toward stores such as @entity206 and @entity207 " where you can get the feeling . " sometimes just shortening a sleeve makes a huge difference , she says .

@entity19 's " silhouettes are fairly consistent . ... it 's a classic business look , " @placeholder says
