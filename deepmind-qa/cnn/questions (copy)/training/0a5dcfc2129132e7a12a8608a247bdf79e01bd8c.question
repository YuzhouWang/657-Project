@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 tempers flared during a routine conference call when @entity6 and @entity7 leadership aides confronted @entity9 staffers over recent comments by party chairman @entity11 . at issue was @entity11 's prediction earlier this week during his nationwide book tour that the @entity3 would not take back the @entity6 in november -- comments that infuriated @entity9 strategists on @entity17 , who decided to broach the topic during the wednesday call . the dispute -- first reported by @entity22 -- occurred on a daily strategy call with aides from @entity9 leadership offices in the @entity6 and @entity7 , along with @entity9 officials . according to a senior @entity6 aide who was on the conference call , a @entity7 staffer said the chairman was trampling on the @entity3 's message in a week that saw several high - profile @entity33 retirements . the @entity7 aide told @entity9 staffers to do a better job controlling their chairman . " he is digging himself deeper , " the @entity7 aide griped about @entity11 , according to the @entity6 source . " he 's got to stop and put an end to this thing . " @entity9 research director @entity43 jumped in and " offered a hard defense of @entity11 , " according to the senior @entity6 aide . @entity43 shot back that the @entity7 official was " out of line , " which then set off a round of " bickering , " the @entity6 aide told @entity1 . a @entity6 aide chimed in to express sympathy with the plight of @entity11 's advisers but said the chairman 's remarks could do serious damage to fundraising , candidate recruiting and voter motivation ahead of the midterm elections . " you guys got to tell us how long this is going to last , " the @entity6 aide said . " our phones are ringing off the hook . he is putting our bosses in difficult positions . " the call ended shortly thereafter . asked for comment on the flare - up , @entity9 spokeswoman @entity71 e-mailed : " not commenting on staff calls . " the senior @entity6 aide later told @entity1 that congressional republicans have " confronted " @entity11 over the past year about some of his comments . " he has been confronted numerous times by @entity7 leaders and @entity6 leaders over the last year , " the aide said . " they have confronted him about speaking about things he should n't be speaking about , whether it 's @entity7 policy or @entity6 policy . " " today , he threw a temper tantrum and told people to shut up , " the aide said , referring to an @entity88 interview in which @entity11 lashed out at his critics . " at this point , he needs to look in the mirror . "
