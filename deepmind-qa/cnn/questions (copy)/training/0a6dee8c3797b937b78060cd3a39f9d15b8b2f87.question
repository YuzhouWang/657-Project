( @entity0 ) -- perhaps it really was destiny . " @entity5 , " the little film that overcame tremendous odds simply to earn an @entity9 release , won eight @entity3 sunday night at the 81st annual @entity3 , including best picture . " most of all we had passion and we had belief , and our film shows if you have those two things , you have everything , " said producer @entity10 , surrounded by many members of the film 's huge cast and crew . it was a supremely unlikely success story . " @entity23 , " which combines elements of @entity27 melodrama and documentary grit , features no stars . it 's set largely among the poverty - stricken districts of @entity31 , @entity32 , and one - third of the film is in @entity34 . its initially reluctant director , @entity35 , is better known for brash @entity38 films such as " trainspotting " and " @entity39 . " and the film almost went straight to @entity41 in @entity9 , thanks to the folding of initial studio @entity44 ( like @entity0 , it 's a unit of @entity46 ) . but the film 's orphaned , poverty - raised hero , played by @entity49 , overcomes his challenges to earn a spot on the game show " @entity23 " -- not necessarily to win money , but to connect with his lost love . on the show , he 's told that perhaps he is a figure of destiny . " it is written , " the show 's smarmy host tells him , somewhat mockingly , after @entity49 's character aces several questions . list of winners , nominees " @entity5 's " filmmakers were jubilant at the wins , which also included @entity3 for best director ( @entity35 ) , best adapted screenplay ( @entity69 ) , score ( @entity71 ) , cinematography ( @entity73 ) , song , sound mixing and film editing . @entity35 jumped up and down as he accepted his award , saying he 'd told his children that if he ever won , he 'd bounce like @entity79 from " @entity80 . " @entity71 was equally appreciative . " all my life i 've had a choice between hate and love , and i chose love , and now i 'm here , " he said . gallery : see what the stars are wearing Â» " @entity5 's " main competition , " @entity90 , " won just three @entity3 , all in minor categories . the film had led the pack with 13 nominations . the rest of the @entity3 broadcast alternated between host @entity98 's smooth song - and - dance numbers , some comic moments from @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , and politics , generally focused on gay rights and @entity106 's anti-gay marriage proposition 8 . @entity107 won best actor for playing @entity109 in " milk , " the story of the first openly gay man elected to major public office . @entity107 earned laughs and applause for his speech . ireport.com : what do you think of the winners ? " you commie homo - loving sons of guns , " the sometimes truculent actor began , to laughter . " i did not expect this , and i wanted to be very clear that i do know how hard i make it to appreciate me , often . but i am touched by the appreciation . " after a series of thank - you 's , he turned serious in talking about gay marriage . " for those who saw the signs of hatred as our cars drove in tonight , i think it 's a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect on their great shame and their shame in their grandchildren 's eyes if they continue that support , " @entity107 said . " we 've got to have equal rights for everyone . " @entity150 , who won original screenplay for " milk , " also gave an impassioned speech in favor of gay rights . " i think [ milk ] would want me to say to all the gay and lesbian kids out there tonight ... that you are beautiful , wonderful creatures of value , and that no matter what anyone tells you , @entity159 does love you and that very soon , i promise you , you will have equal rights , federally , across this great nation of ours . " @entity169 won best supporting actor for his performance as the @entity172 in " @entity173 . " his parents and sister accepted the award for the actor , who died in january 2008 . " this award tonight would have humbly validated @entity169 's quiet determination to be truly accepted by you all here -- his peers -- within an industry he truly loved , " said @entity169 's father , @entity179 . @entity169 is only the second actor to win a posthumous actor . @entity189 won best actor for 1976 's " network " two months after he died in early 1977 . other winners included @entity193 , who won best actress for her performance in " @entity196 " ; @entity197 , who won best supporting actress honor for " @entity199 " ; and " @entity202 , " which won best animated feature . most of the winners , if not foreordained , were expected . the evening 's sole shock came with best foreign - language film , which went to the @entity208 film " @entity209 . " among the films it beat were @entity213 's " @entity212 " and @entity215 's " dances with @entity216 , " two of the best - reviewed films of the year . the @entity3 moved at a steady pace , largely thanks to @entity98 's brisk , jokey work . only the introductions to the four acting categories , in which previous winners read tributes to current nominees as if they were about to appear on " @entity225 , " considerably slowed the show , which ran close to three and a half hours . at various points , @entity98 cracked wise about downsizing -- " next year , " said the " @entity230 " star , " i 'll be starring in a movie called ' @entity232 ' " -- performed songs about each best picture nominee in various musical styles , and paid tribute to various celebrities as if pointing out vips in a nightclub . he even physically carried @entity241 on stage to play @entity243 in a " @entity244 " send - up . blog : behind the scenes but it was " @entity5 " that carried the evening . at one point , @entity249 , who won for sound mixing , seemed overwhelmed as he accepted his @entity3 . " i dedicate this award to my country , " he said . " thank you , @entity3 , this is not just a sound award , this is history being handed over to me . " given the import of @entity259 , the movie business can say the same thing .
