how bad has it gotten for embattled @entity2 mayor @entity1 ? even @entity3 -- the restaurant chain sometimes criticized for its scantily clad waitresses -- says he 's no longer welcome . the chain 's downtown location has joined a campaign by a local radio talk - show host , who 's urging businesses to post signs in their window that declare @entity1 persona non grata . the signs note that the mayor " will not be served in this establishment " and " we believe women should be treated with respect . " in a statement posted on @entity22 , the company said restaurant acted on its own . " our @entity24 in @entity2 have spoken . not a corporate gig , but we support our girls , " it read . @entity2 mayor not welcome : photos of the @entity3 sign refusing to resign in the face of mounting allegations that he groped and made lewd comments toward numerous women , @entity1 is facing an effort to recall him from office . and now a city councilman wants him to answer questions about more than $ 500 in charges on his official city credit card from a downtown hotel . " when you see statements like this , it raises the question of is city business being done or not , " councilman @entity44 said tuesday . @entity51 obtained @entity1 's municipal credit - card statements from january to may . the taxpayer - paid card included charges ranging from less than $ 30 to about $ 111 at the @entity55 , including one incurred on a sunday . the @entity56 is across the street from the mayor 's office . regulars at the bar who did not want to speak on - camera told @entity51 that @entity1 was often here , usually with a different woman . @entity44 , a @entity66 who sits on the council 's audit committee , raised questions about other charges as well -- $ 3,000 to an online reputation - management firm , $ 128 for a juicer and a $ 30,000 trip to @entity75 . he said @entity1 has promised to reimburse the city for that trip , but there has been no proof of a refund . secrets that women of @entity2 no longer keep about its mayor the 70 - year - old @entity1 was elected mayor of the eighth - largest @entity86 city in 2012 , after 10 terms in @entity88 . his accusers range from a singer at a campaign fundraiser to his former communications director , who called him unfit for office . he 's rebuffed calls to resign from all nine city council members and from his fellow @entity96 , including @entity98 's two @entity86 senators . he now faces a recall effort that is trying to gather more than 100,000 signatures needed to put his future up to a new vote , though some political observers doubt organizers can succeed . @entity1 issued a required response to the notice of a petition drive tuesday , arguing that voters should weigh his administration 's push for new parks , high - tech jobs , better roads and a 2024 @entity115 bid before they decide to whether they want to turn him out of office . " now is not the time to go backwards -- back to the time when middle - class jobs and neighborhood infrastructure were sacrificed to downtown special interests , " @entity1 said in a written response to a proposed recall petition . " we need to continue to move forward ! " did mayor target victims of military sexual assault ? but @entity128 , the head of the recall effort , said @entity1 " obviously believes his policy initiatives excuse his being a sexual predator . " " his reply is unacceptable , " @entity128 said . " @entity133 want a mayor that does n't grope and demean women , who does n't abuse his office to satisfy a perverted quest for a sense of power , and who has the ability to lead our great city -- an ability @entity1 can never , ever reclaim . " @entity1 has brought " great shame " on the city , @entity128 said , vowing , " we will recall him from office . " in july , @entity1 acknowledged that he " failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me " and that he was " embarrassed " by his actions . but he also said he will be vindicated by " a full presentation of the facts " and he will not resign . " we have moved toward the vision of producing thousands of middle - class jobs in our port ; creating a solar - based city to enhance our environment and create jobs ; building an efficient international border to bring billions of dollars into our economy ; keeping our military and hi - tech sectors strong and vibrant , " @entity1 said in response to the recall petition notice . he touted new support for the arts , a five - year labor agreement with city workers and work toward bringing the summer olympics to the city . out of rehab , but also locked out of office the mayor entered a two - week intensive behavior therapy program on july 29 , but his attorney , @entity175 , said @entity1 was able to complete that phase of treatment by saturday . he 'll continue with outpatient treatment , @entity175 said -- but he might not be back at work in his office anytime soon . his chief of staff changed the locks , according to numerous reports , including one by @entity51 affiliate @entity184 . and after weeks of complaints , some observers are questioning whether more should have been said about @entity1 's behavior before last year 's election . " i think there was a lot of whispering , " former state assemblywoman @entity189 told @entity51 . " it was a lot of things under the surface . a lot of ' boys will be boys . ' " @entity189 said she brought complaints about @entity1 to @entity202 's @entity96 leader two years ago after hearing accounts of harassing behavior from six women . nothing happened , she said . " it was considered abusive . it was insulting at times . and i think people need to pay attention to those reports , and it did n't happen two years ago , " said @entity189 , also a @entity209 . @entity1 's 2012 opponent , city councilman @entity214 , hinted at the issue during a mayoral debate . video of the event shows @entity214 telling voters , " you need a mayor who 's going to insist on zero tolerance of sexual harassment in the workplace " -- turning to look at @entity1 while he makes the comment . @entity214 is now running for @entity88 and had no comment . but his mayoral campaign featured a television spot in which an @entity230 airport worker who had a run - in with @entity1 described his actions as " scary and hostile . " " i deal with frustrated travelers every day , but i never came across anyone like @entity1 , " she said . opinion : no room for lecherous mayors
