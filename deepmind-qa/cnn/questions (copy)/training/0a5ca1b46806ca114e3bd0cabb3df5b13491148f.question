( @entity0 ) -- " @entity1 ought to end at the water 's edge " is a longstanding adage of @entity6 politics . but in the hours after the death of the first @entity6 ambassador killed in decades , @entity8 -- panicked as his poll numbers have slipped -- punched hard against the president , unleashing an unwise , inaccurate and unpresidential attack on the @entity14 administration . the fog of war applies to the confusion about the timeline of ugly incidents in the @entity20 on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks . but when the @entity6 @entity24 in @entity25 released a statement condemning the obscure and intentionally inflammatory film that had already given rise to riots , the @entity8 campaign saw an opportunity to amplify its " @entity32 " narrative . politics : @entity8 's political pretzel over @entity35 despite the fact that @entity6 missions in @entity39 and @entity35 came under attack after that embassy statement , with crowds besieging the @entity25 embassy and the consulate in @entity45 in the late hours of september 11 , the campaign released a statement from @entity8 saying , " it 's disgraceful that the @entity49 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks . " this barely qualifies as dog - whistle politics . at a moment when sovereign @entity6 soil was under attack by @entity61 radicals , the @entity8 campaign tried to tie the president to those extremists attacking us , saying that he had " sympathy " with their cause . and then , in the clear light of morning , @entity8 doubled down on the claim , repeating it -- perhaps for fear of appearing weak -- and his campaign released talking points to hammer home the point . he picked precisely the wrong time , and over the wrong issue , to go " bold . " politics : @entity80 turmoil evokes political response this is not just politics as usual but something far lower . by point of comparison , when @entity88 was confronted with the downed - helicopter rescue mission ordered by president @entity90 to save the @entity6 hostages in the @entity24 in @entity92 , he did not see it as opportunity to score political points . instead , @entity88 said , " this is the time for us as a nation and a people to stand united . " likewise , @entity100 , then also running for president , said " i unequivocally support the president of the @entity6 -- no ifs , ands or buts -- and it certainly is not a time to try to go one - up politically . he made a difficult , courageous decision . " ( hat - tip to the @entity109 for unearthing these statements . ) no wonder a wide array of @entity113 foreign policy experts rose to condemn @entity8 's comments , including the longtime speechwriter and senior aide to sen. @entity118 , @entity119 , who wrote : " to condemn ( @entity14 ) for policies they claim helped precipitate the attacks is as tortured in its reasoning as it is unseemly in its timing . " i called one of the wise men of @entity6 foreign policy , @entity131 , a longtime first deputy to @entity88 secretary of state @entity132 and now a professor at @entity134 and a research fellow at the @entity136 , as well as the author of " @entity138 " and " @entity139 : @entity140 and @entity61 . " " in my opinion , @entity14 is rightly criticized for a foreign policy approach that has not been firm enough . but in this case , the @entity8 statement was overreaction and not proper , " @entity131 said . " @entity8 should be standing as an @entity6 with @entity6 right now and not trying to narrowly pursue political profit . i would not have advised him to release that statement . " on the flip side were conservative populist luminaries like @entity149 , who took to @entity150 , her only dependable perch these days , to write this : " we already know that president @entity14 likes to ' speak softly ' to our enemies . if he does n't have a ' big stick ' to carry , maybe it 's time for him to grow one . " once again , @entity149 proved that she does n't have the temperament or the intellect to be within a thousand feet of the @entity160 . opinion : @entity35 killings show @entity6 at risk n @entity165 world it is also noteworthy that the @entity8 campaign 's instinct is to attack the president on foreign policy but then refuse to articulate its own policy positions as a useful point of contrast . this " attack and distract " approach to politics is beneath the office ; when you criticize there is an obligation to propose new solutions to the problem . when @entity8 embarked on his @entity185 tour , he frequently cited the tradition of not criticizing a president while traveling overseas as justification for not answering questions about his own foreign policy beliefs . this seemed to many , including me , at the time to be a high - minded excuse to avoid answering specific questions . now there is no doubt . it was not decency or a desire to get all the facts before condemning the president that restrained his campaign 's rhetoric . many questions still remain . the online " film " that apparently provoked the attack seems thrown together and badly over-dubbed to create maximum insult to @entity207 . it has been promoted by some of the most discredited conspiracy entrepreneurs on our side of the @entity109 , including the " reverend " @entity215 , who advocated @entity216 - burning in the past . the @entity6 principle of defending free speech can not be allowed to be compromised by fanatics anywhere for any reason . there is , as the president said wednesday in the @entity224 , " no excuse " for the actions of this murderous mob in @entity35 or for the invasion of the embassy in @entity39 . reports are emerging that the @entity45 siege was a premeditated attack by our enemies . @entity131 describes unsettling parallels : " with the radical @entity207 , there 's a kind of connection between the crazy guys in @entity241 who make this film and the crazy guys in @entity35 who plan these attacks deliberately and use the films as an excuse , a provocation , " he says . " there 's a kind of demonic conspiracy between these two types of fringe groups , and it makes life less secure for the rest of us . " opinion : extremists do n't speak for @entity35 @entity8 is a good man , but his lack of core political beliefs combined with his otherwise admirable competitiveness has led him to make claims about opponents that are often overheated and unrelated to reality . the dishonest drumbeat that @entity14 travels around the world compulsively apologizing for @entity6 is a core @entity8 campaign tactic . this time , he went definitively too far -- trying to score petty political points with incomplete information at a time when our nation 's embassies were being attacked overseas on the anniversary of september 11 . it was disgraceful . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .

@entity278 : the move , apparently for political points , was widely condemned even among @placeholder
