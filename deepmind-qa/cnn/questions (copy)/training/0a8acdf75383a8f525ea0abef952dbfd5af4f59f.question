( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 may be a risk averse president focused more on the middle class as his legacy than on the @entity5 . but @entity7 ' advances against @entity8 ( where there are @entity11 troops and diplomats ) and its brutality against the @entity14 and @entity15 gave him no choice but to become more risk ready . but we should be under no illusion that targeted airstrikes against @entity7 and humanitarian assistance to besieged minorities means a transformation in the president 's views about @entity26 , a slippery slope to military intervention , or the beginning of a new save the @entity5 campaign . @entity1 is likely to remain a very cautious , risk - averse president . and here 's why . the ' extricator - in - chief ' @entity1 's own political legitimacy is intertwined with a commitment to withdraw @entity11 forces from @entity37 and @entity26 , the two longest and among the most profitless wars in @entity11 history . this is both a campaign promise and one about which the president feels very strongly . he knows he ca n't fix @entity26 and if there is a red line in his world view that wo n't turn pink , it is his opposition to redeploying @entity11 forces back into @entity26 at any significant level . he is in this regard the extricator - in - chief determined to get the @entity11 out of old wars and not into new ones . that , combined with @entity1 's wariness about using military force in an open - ended conflict without clear purpose and his aversion to appearing to take the @entity62 side , particularly one identified with @entity63 , a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the vast majority of the @entity26 public , should serve as a brake against an expansive mission creep . the @entity70 precedent the president 's risk aversion will be strengthened by the way things turned out in @entity70 . there , in 2010 , in an effort to prevent @entity77 's forces from killing thousands of civilians in @entity79 , the @entity11 and @entity80 mobilized a coalition backed by the @entity83 , the @entity84 and @entity85 . despite action by all these formidable forces , it took an eight - month effort by @entity85 to facilitate the opposition 's efforts to overthrow the @entity70 dictator . more important , today @entity70 is a mess riven by tribal and regional rivalries . and to boot , for the first time since 1988 , a @entity11 ambassador was killed in a terrorist attack in @entity79 . @entity1 knows that there are clear limits to what he can do in @entity26 and that even a much more ambitious commitment will not produce results . on the contrary , it will lead to a trap in which the @entity11 is likely to become ensnared . if you could n't fix @entity26 in a decade of effort , $ 25 billion to support the @entity26 military and a trillion dollars or more to prop up the @entity26 government , you 're not going to fix it now . 800 + days and counting governing is about choosing , particularly as a president watches the sands run through the hourglass in a second term . it may well be that @entity1 's clock has run out with respect to new domestic initiatives . the really tough issues -- dealing with a grand bargain on tax increases and entitlement reform and climate change -- are probably beyond his capacity to realize . even immigration reform will likely be a bridge too far . he may well find himself suffering significant losses in the @entity128 and perhaps even the loss of the @entity130 in the november 2014 midterms . @entity1 could well complete his second term with his major accomplishments being realized in his first . that said , he has no intention of having his remaining less than 1,000 days be consumed with an @entity26 war he ca n't win or with a legacy that will be compared to his predecessor @entity138 , who took @entity11 into @entity26 in 2003 . those prospects will virtually ensure a determined effort to keep the @entity26 venture limited . if possible , he will share with other nations the humanitarian dimension so the @entity11 does n't have to bear the sole responsibility . one thing is clear . while @entity1 acted quickly this time around to protect @entity11 and alleviate the suffering of threatened minority groups , he has no intention of becoming the @entity149 of @entity26 . not even @entity138 was prepared to do that . @entity7 : a threat to the @entity11 ? last year , there were 17,891 global fatalities due to terrorism . of that number , 16 were @entity11 . terrorism from @entity7 or anyone else is not right now a strategic threat to the continental @entity11 . it is to our allies , however , particularly in @entity162 . and it could become a threat to us , too . with millions of dollars , stolen passports and foreign fighters , @entity7 could if it chose make a bid not just to strike at the so - called near enemy ( @entity162 , @entity26 , @entity170 ) but at the far enemy , too ( the @entity11 ) . @entity7 has its hands full at the moment . striking @entity7 could well provide it with an added incentive to strike back at @entity11 targets in the region and over time at @entity11 . @entity7 ' bold threat today that its flag will one day fly over the @entity128 is sheer delusion . but it means that this vicious group could direct its attention at the @entity11 . indeed , an attack against the @entity11 or its assets in the region would clearly be the one trigger that could impel the president to do now what he clearly wants to avoid : launch a major military campaign to strike at @entity7 in @entity26 and @entity189 . what 's the endgame ? the biggest challenge for the president is that limited strikes against @entity7 targets may protect @entity11 , buck up the @entity196 , and perhaps defuse the current threat to the @entity14 minority on the mountaintop . but they can not put @entity26 back together again , save all persecuted minorities from @entity7 brutality or help create a new political contract among @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity62 . @entity26 is likely to continue to bleed and we ca n't stop that . the president was right to act and may well be called on to do so again . indeed , we ca n't rule out the possibility that he would send in more special forces . he can try to enlist other nations , work with @entity11 's regional allies , and push for internal reconciliation among @entity26 politicians . but he 's also right to be cautious and realistic about what he can really accomplish . we can not save @entity26 from itself or from its neighbors , particularly @entity220 , whose vision for @entity26 is much different than ours . this was a bridge too far when @entity138 tried to cross it in 2003 . and it remains one to this day .
