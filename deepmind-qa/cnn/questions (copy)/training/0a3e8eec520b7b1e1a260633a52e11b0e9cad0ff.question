( @entity0 ) -- i bet that @entity2 is not typically serenaded by mariachis . but then , this week was anything but typical for the @entity6 congressman from @entity7 . @entity2 traveled to @entity8 -- and across the aisle -- to appear alongside rep. @entity10 , @entity11 , perhaps @entity12 ' most vocal proponent of immigration reform . the two men gave a joint presentation at the @entity16 , where -- even in that bluest of blue cities -- the business friendly audience probably favors many of @entity2 's economic policies . before that , the two lawmakers went into a @entity24 neighborhood to meet with activists , members of the clergy and immigrant advocates . it was there that the mariachis greeted them . in the crowd , a man appreciatively held up a banner with @entity2 's photo on it and the words : " @entity39 , @entity2 . " for immigration reform advocates , there is a lot for which to be thankful these days . at a time when more and more republicans in @entity12 are expressing skepticism about a @entity47 bill that combines border security with a guest worker program and legal status for the undocumented , @entity2 is doubling down on his support . he thinks the current system is failing us . he told the crowd that what we 're doing now is bad for national security , bad for business , bad for communities and bad for families . right you are , congressman . on all counts . during the visit , @entity2 told reporters : " i would say for the sake of our national security , we want to modernize our immigration laws . we do not even know how to track people who overstay their visas . we need a modern immigration system that helps us not only protect our border but protects national security in all of its aspects . so if anything , i would say this is an argument for modernizing our immigration laws . we need it for national security , we need it for our economy . " and when @entity2 , the chairman of the @entity80 , talks about the economy , he is on familiar terrain . " if you take a look at contributions that immigrants make to society ... it produces faster economic growth , which brings in more revenue to the federal government , " he said . " so if you look at this issue in its totality , immigration is a net positive contributor to the economy . " the congressman also knows his way around the immigration issue . in 2005 , as @entity10 reminded the crowd , @entity2 co-sponsored an immigration reform bill in the @entity80 that was ultimately voted down . he has said he is especially concerned that employers , including the kinds of farmers and ranchers who populate his home state , have access to the labor they need to stay in business . in fact , over the last decade , @entity2 has supported or co-sponsored what the anti-immigrant group , @entity113 , disdainfully called " various amnesties to give illegal aliens a path to citizenship . " it 's one reason that the group -- which advocates both an end to illegal immigration and a dramatic reduction in legal immigration , to pre- 1965 levels -- gave @entity2 's career in @entity12 a " @entity131 " that grade puts him in the bottom 10 % of all current @entity6 members of @entity12 , according to the group 's executive director , @entity129 . and , conversely , it puts him in the top 10 % , as far as many @entity133 are concerned . you see , it only helps build @entity2 's " street cred " that he 's not popular with groups that attract so many @entity139 nativists . the 2012 @entity6 vice presidential nominee is almost certain to run for the top job in 2016 as part of what could turn out to be a crowded field . other contenders for the @entity6 presidential nomination could include sen. @entity147 of @entity148 , sen. @entity149 of @entity150 , @entity152 gov. @entity151 , @entity154 gov. @entity153 and former @entity148 gov. @entity155 . with that kind of lineup , you can expect immigration to be a top issue in the @entity6 primary . @entity147 is the de facto spokesman for the 844 - page comprehensive immigration reform bill cobbled together by the @entity47 's " gang of eight . " @entity149 is a vocal critic of the plan . lately , @entity155 seems to have cornered the market on just about every position imaginable on a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants . @entity2 needs to get his ducks in a row . was this week 's trip to @entity8 the kick - off of his 2016 @entity24 outreach efforts ? if so , will it work ? it could , if it is followed up by other visits and more speeches and continued attention to @entity24 concerns . it 's a start . if @entity2 talks less , and listens more , he 'll stand out from other politicians and could impress @entity24 voters as someone whose interests , on some issues , align with theirs . the @entity6 is doing a lot of soul - searching these days trying to figure out how to get @entity133 to show them some love . there are strategy sessions and focus groups and smarty - pants consultants with their pie charts and bar graphs . but folks make this stuff harder than it really is . in the world of @entity24 outreach , sometimes , it 's the little things that count for a lot . like a @entity6 congressman from @entity7 taking an unexpected detour to say his piece and pay his respects to a constituency poorly served by both parties , despite the likelihood that he 'll be hammered by some in his own party . like the man said -- @entity39 , @entity2 . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .

he says many in @entity6 oppose @placeholder bill ; @entity133 know @entity2 has record of backing reform
