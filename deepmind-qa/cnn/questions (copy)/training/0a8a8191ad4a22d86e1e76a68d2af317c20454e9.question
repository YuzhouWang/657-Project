( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 masters -- april 9 - 12 , 2009 2007 @entity3 champion @entity3 puts the green jacket on 2008 winner @entity5 . while @entity6 at @entity7 , @entity8 may rival it for history , few would argue that the @entity2 masters tournament is unrivalled in terms of beauty and exclusivity . played at the prestigious @entity15 in the city of @entity15 , @entity17 , the first " major " of the golfing year is a strictly invitational event controlled by the club itself . the top 50 golfers in the official world rankings are all guaranteed an invite . the dramatic azalea - draped course -- the brainchild of golfing great @entity27 -- provides a tough test for the world 's elite golfers , particularly since it has been lengthened or " @entity31 - proofed " in recent years . however the relatively short 12th hole , named @entity33 , is arguably the most challenging . @entity34 once called it " the hardest tournament hole in golf , " due to the fact that its perilously narrow green is protected in front by @entity39 , with two sand traps behind it . misjudge the wind or get your club selection wrong and the ball will most likely end up in the water . since @entity50 won the inaugural @entity52 title in 1934 , the tournament has become as famous for its traditions as it has for the quality of golf on show . winners are presented with a green jacket by the defending champion -- which they are obliged to return to the clubhouse the following year . @entity34 , nicknamed the " @entity34 , " became the first golfer to successfully defend his green jacket . he also holds the record for the most titles won at @entity15 with six -- his last coming in 1986 at the age of 46 . @entity2 players currently dominate the competition , following a period in the 1980s and 1990s which saw @entity73 players , including @entity74 and @entity75 , win 10 titles in 17 years . current world number one @entity31 has won four times at @entity15 since 1997 , while compatriot and rival for top spot , @entity82 , won in 2004 and 2006 . @entity83 's @entity5 is the current owner of the coveted green jacket . 2008 season in pictures » @entity87 - june 15 - 21 , 2009 @entity31 and his caddie walk up to the 18th green on the @entity90 at @entity91 in 2002 . the second of the four major tournaments , the @entity87 is hosted by the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) . since its inaugural event in 1895 at the @entity98 and @entity97 , the event has been staged at a number of different courses . what 's your favorite tournament ? it was n't until 1913 that the @entity87 championship really caught the imagination when a young @entity2 amateur , @entity107 , stunned the golf world by defeating famous @entity110 professionals , @entity111 and @entity112 , in a playoff . the format of the tournament has changed several times . the @entity94 extended the championship to 72 holes in 1898 , with 36 holes played on each of two days . in 1926 , the format was changed to 18 holes played each of two days , then 36 holes on the third day . in 1965 , the present format of four 18 - hole daily rounds was implemented for the first time . over the years , much has been made of the way @entity87 courses have been set up , with incredibly tough pin positions and rough thick enough to require a compass to navigate through . " sometimes the players feel [ the @entity94 ] has gotten a little close to the edge on some holes , " defending champion @entity129 told the @entity134 at @entity135 , @entity136 in 2005 . two years later , when @entity138 in @entity139 hosted the tournament , @entity137 quoted @entity31 as saying " a 10 - handicapper did n't stand a chance at breaking 100 " on a course that boasts over 200 deep bunkers . @entity27 , @entity34 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 have all triumphed at the @entity87 on four occasions , while @entity31 , who won last year 's event at @entity150 following a dramatic playoff victory over @entity152 , counts three so far among his haul of 14 major titles . the @entity87 is the only major that requires participants to play - off over 18 holes . this year 's event at @entity91 's @entity90 in @entity159 , @entity157 should be familiar to @entity31 , as he won here in 2002 . at 7,214 - yards , the municipally - owned @entity161 was the longest @entity87 course in history . the aptly - named @entity90 even carries a warning sign about its difficulty on the first tee . in 2002 , @entity2 @entity147 missed the cut for only the sixth time in 33 @entity87 starts after two torrid rounds of 82 and 81 . " they can go out and write a new book and title it , ' @entity174 at ... wherever the heck we are , " @entity175 quoted him as saying . it remains to be seen whether the recently - injured @entity31 can tame the course once again . watch more about @entity31 ' comeback » the @entity6 -- july 16 - 19 , 2009 @entity181 ( right ) and @entity182 line up putts during the @entity184 at @entity185 . organized by the @entity186 , which takes its name from @entity188 , @entity8 , the ( @entity189 ) @entity6 is the oldest of the four major tournaments . it is also the only one held outside of the @entity2 . first held in october , 1860 , @entity6 was mostly played in @entity8 during its early years . @entity192 in @entity193 was the birthplace of the event , which saw just eight players compete in its inaugural year . a year later the tournament was declared open to the whole world and the event has been known simply as " @entity6 " ever since . since the early days , the @entity186 has established a rota of @entity189 seaside " links " courses to host the event . the major difference between a links course and a parkland course -- such as @entity15 -- is that it is far less manufactured . links courses are constructed out of the sandy , windswept coastal terrain , with few " man - made " additions . players are faced with thick rough , narrow undulating fairways that snake around dunes , and lightening quick greens . there are far fewer trees and water hazards . when the wind gusts these courses demand the highest level of skill and imagination . this year 's tournament will be held on the famous @entity225 course at @entity226 on the west coast of @entity8 . with its dramatic views and elevated cliff - top holes , the 7,200 yard course previously hosted @entity6 in 1977 , 1986 , 1994 . the winning aggregate scores in 1977 and 1994 rank among the lowest recorded in @entity87 history , largely because the wind was n't blowing as it can . current open champion @entity181 will arrive at @entity226 looking to win the tournament for the third time in as many years . at @entity238 in 2007 , @entity181 became the first @entity239 to win @entity6 since @entity240 in 1947 . he defended his title the following year at @entity185 , finishing four strokes ahead of @entity110 's @entity243 . @entity181 has a long way to go before matching the great @entity111 's record of six @entity87 victories between 1896 and 1914 . surprisingly , @entity2 golfers -- more used to parkland courses -- have enjoyed great success in the competition in recent years , with 10 wins in 12 years . @entity31 , who missed out through injury last year , lifted the @entity253 in 2000 , 2005 and 2006 . @entity254 -- august 10 - 16 , 2009 @entity181 pumps his fist as he sinks a putt to win the 2008 @entity254 at @entity257 . the final major of the year , the @entity254 is organized by the @entity259 ( @entity259 ) and is also held at a different course each year . the brainchild of @entity157 salesman @entity262 , the first @entity254 was held at @entity263 in @entity264 , @entity157 in 1916 -- the same year the @entity259 was founded . the winners ' trophy is named after him . the competition , which was only switched from a matchplay to a strokeplay format in 1958 , does not allow amateurs to compete . it always attracts a world class field , in addition to a number of ordinary club professionals in the @entity2 who can qualify through a national tournament . this year 's tournament will be held at @entity279 in @entity280 , @entity281 , the scene of @entity284 's defeat of a charging @entity31 in 2002 . @entity284 , an unknown club professional who also sold car stereos , held off @entity31 by recording birdies in his final four holes for a 68 that gave him victory by just one shot . the 7,149 - yard course is ranked among the top courses in the @entity2 , according to the @entity259 . its signature 16th hole features a wide open fairway that narrows into a long peninsula featuring an elevated green protected by @entity299 . this year @entity181 will attempt to defend the trophy , a year after he pulled off a dramatic victory over @entity303 's @entity302 at @entity257 . if he succeeds he will become only the second man -- after @entity31 -- to be back - to - back @entity254 . however , both men lag behind @entity34 , who won a record - equaling fifth @entity259 title in 1980 at @entity307 , @entity308 -- the hometown of @entity309 , the player whose record @entity34 tied .
