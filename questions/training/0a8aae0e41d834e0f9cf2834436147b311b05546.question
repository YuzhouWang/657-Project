( @entity0 ) -- gov. @entity1 on wednesday said sen. @entity2 has ties to a @entity5 professor who she said is " a former spokesperson for the @entity7 . " the @entity2 campaign said on its web site that " ugly insinuations about @entity2 's relationship with a former neighbor and university colleague ... are completely false . " the professor has denied he was a spokesman for the @entity7 . @entity1 said her assertion " is not negative campaigning to call someone out on their record . " " it seems that there is yet another radical professor from the neighborhood who spent a lot of time with @entity2 going back several years , " @entity1 said at an event in @entity21 , @entity22 . " this is important because his associate , @entity32 ... in addition to being a political ally of @entity2 , he 's a former spokesperson for the @entity7 . " watch @entity1 say the @entity35 is ' kowtowing ' to @entity2 » sen. @entity37 's campaign repeatedly has sought to tie @entity2 to former 1960s radical @entity38 , who co-founded the @entity39 . @entity38 is a professor at the @entity40 . @entity32 has been a harsh critic of @entity42 foreign policy toward @entity43 and has accused the country of " occupying " @entity46 territories . but he has denied acting as a @entity7 spokesman during a seven - year period in the 1970s and 1980s . @entity32 said wednesday , " i am not speaking to the media at this time , and certainly not until this idiot wind passes . " the @entity2 campaign called @entity1 's remarks " another recycled , manufactured controversy from the @entity37 campaign to distract voters ' attention from @entity37 's lockstep support for @entity60 's economic policies . " in april , the @entity35 published an article about a going - away dinner for @entity32 that @entity2 attended in @entity63 , @entity64 , in 2003 . @entity32 was leaving to become a professor at @entity5 . watch @entity37 push @entity2 's link to @entity32 » the paper reported that a young @entity46 - @entity42 woman recited a poem at the farewell party that accused the @entity43 government of terrorism for its treatment of @entity74 and was highly critical of @entity42 support of @entity43 . the @entity37 campaign accused the @entity78 paper of " intentionally suppressing " a videotape it obtained from that dinner and demanded that it release the footage . the @entity35 said it wo n't release the footage because a reporter promised a source that the video would not be made public . asked why the @entity37 campaign was bringing the matter up six months after the article appeared , an aide replied , " because we are one week away from potentially electing @entity2 . " at an event wednesday in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity2 said @entity37 has spent the last few days calling him " every name in the book . " " i do n't know what 's next . by the end of the week , he 'll be accusing me of being a secret communist because i shared my toys in kindergarten . i shared my peanut butter and jelly sandwich , " @entity2 said . watch @entity2 scoff at ' socialist ' label » earlier wednesday , @entity1 delivered her second policy address of the campaign season . @entity1 said she and @entity37 are determined to put the country on " a path toward energy independence " and charged that an @entity2 administration would hinder that process . @entity1 pointed to her experience as governor as evidence she can help the @entity42 achieve energy security . " whatever the good ol ' boys are running these days , i know it 's not the state of @entity121 , " she said in @entity116 , @entity22 . @entity1 said that by relying on oil from the @entity130 , " we not only provide wealth to the sponsors of terror , but we provide high - value targets to the terrorists themselves . " the @entity121 governor stressed expanding drilling , using nuclear power and tapping into the " @entity42 ingenuity " to solve the energy problem . " energy security is one of the great questions in this election , " @entity1 said . " sometimes i think it 's no wonder that our opponents do n't want to talk a whole lot about this , because they do n't get it . " achieving energy security , @entity1 said , requires a " clean break " from the policies of the @entity60 administration and from " 30 years ' worth of failed energy policies in @entity150 . " @entity1 described the energy plans of @entity2 and sen. @entity152 as a " long , labored agenda of inaction . " the @entity2 campaign sent out a response from @entity22 gov. @entity157 , which said , " @entity1 attacked her own running mate 's record today by blaming our oil addiction on ' 30 years of failure ' in @entity150 . " later wednesday , @entity37 was scheduled to appear on @entity0 's " @entity163 " at 9 p.m. et. watch @entity37 say @entity2 is at the ' far left ' of @entity42 politics » that interview comes after a 30 - minute @entity2 campaign ad , which airs during prime - time television wednesday . it 's the first time in 16 years that a presidential candidate has bought a slot in prime time to make his closing argument . the half - hour ad was set to run on @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 at 8 p.m. et. the spot , which is estimated to have cost about $ 5 million , includes a live segment from @entity180 , with voters discussing their problems and @entity2 laying out his plans for the country . @entity0 declined the @entity2 campaign 's request to air the ad . @entity0 said it did not want to pre-empt its programming lineup with a 30 - minute paid commercial program . @entity2 's closing effort also includes an appearance on @entity193 's " @entity192 " and a late - night rally in @entity195 , @entity180 , with former president clinton . @entity197 have been poking fun at @entity2 's prime - time blitz . the @entity37 campaign released an ad wednesday morning that says , " behind the fancy speeches , the grand promises , the tv specials lies the truth ... @entity2 lacks the experience @entity42 needs , and it shows . " the poll of polls consists of eight surveys : @entity217 ( october 25 - 27 ) , @entity219 - @entity218 ( october 23 - 27 ) , @entity220 ( october 23 - 26 ) , @entity222 / @entity221 ( october 24 - 27 ) , @entity215 / @entity214 / @entity213 ( october 26 - 28 ) , @entity216 ( october 26 - 28 ) , @entity210 ( october 26 - 28 ) , and @entity212 / @entity211 ( october 24 - 28 ) . there is no sampling error . @entity0 's @entity225 and @entity226 contributed to this report .
