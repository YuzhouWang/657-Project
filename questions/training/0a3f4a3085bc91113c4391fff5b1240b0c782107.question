" i did n't want to go , ' here 's a whole bunch of people oppressed by this apartheid-esque society ' and beat people over the head with it , " @entity7 said . " i rather wanted to say this is the city i grew up in , this is what it felt like . " @entity2 's @entity152 contributed to this report .
