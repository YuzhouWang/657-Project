" whan i was a boy , they took away my mother , " @entity1 said in character as a muscle - bound , gun - wielding @entity13 . " and now it 's time for them to pay ... dearly . " he also transformed , hulk - style , into " @entity21 " in a sketch in which president @entity21 is angered by some members of @entity24 . the former professional wrestler spoofed the @entity26 in a promo on " @entity12 . " but that was just a warmup to the actual @entity30 31 on sunday , when the @entity1 thrilled fans with a surprise appearance with @entity34 champion @entity33 to take on @entity26 executives @entity35 and @entity37 the actor is the son of retired professional wrestler @entity39 and wrestled under the name " @entity1 " for years before he transitioned to an acting career .
