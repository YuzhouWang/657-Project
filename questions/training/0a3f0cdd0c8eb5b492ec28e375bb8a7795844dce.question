( @entity0 ) -- when makers of one of the most anticipated video games of the year invited users to help design part of the game , the gamers jumped at the chance to create animated characters . users will have the option to incorporate other people 's " @entity13 " designs or choose to block them all . but some took it upon themselves to create something entirely different : a new kind of internet porn . it started when the makers of " @entity13 " released a @entity22 program that allowed users to develop their own characters to drum up hype before the game 's scheduled release in september . the game , a joint venture from " @entity30 " creator @entity29 and @entity31 , allows users to create a unique creature and then control its evolution from a single cell into a complex cultural civilization . within 24 hours of the @entity38 's release , gamers had gone creature - crazy , designing millions of critters that were all thrown into a database and shown on a @entity42 channel for the public to see . but scrolling through the database -- past the three - legged sea horse , past the seven - eyed wildebeest and the half - motorcycle - half - pig -- revealed something many users did n't expect . buried among the more wholesome attempts were two - legged dancing testicles , a " giant breast monster " and a four - legged " phallic fornication machine , " for starters . @entity55 demonstrate the " @entity38 " and " @entity13 " Â» these naughty -- some would say obscene -- creations have spawned an internet meme nicknamed " @entity59 , " short for " @entity13 " porn . for @entity31 , the developer of " @entity13 , " it 's the downside to tapping into the booming user - generated content arena , which has made sites like @entity42 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 so popular . these games and sites often allow people to create and host their own content in addition to creating cartoon personas , called avatars , for themselves . many of the popular user - generated content sites have faced similar challenges in trying to control obscene material . in @entity69 , users can read @entity81 , a cyberporn magazine , or buy programs that allow them to have animated sex with other characters . " whether it 's modeling clay , dolls or crayons , a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something vulgar , " said @entity85 , " @entity13 's " executive producer . despite its " @entity96 " issues , " @entity13 " is poised to become one of the most popular games because of its ability to let people tell their own story , rather than one mapped out for them , @entity55 said . " rather than putting players in the shoes of @entity107 or @entity108 , we 're giving them the opportunity to be @entity110 or @entity111 , as they create their own universe from scratch , " she said . but for every @entity110 and @entity111 , there 's always a spoiler . enter the @entity116 , a 37 - year - old web developer who refused to give his name for this interview . @entity120 , like many others , has spent hours creating characters and turning them into sexual beings . " it came up simply as something silly and juvenile to do , " he said . the creatures are not just static . users can create animated scenarios for the characters to engage in , some of which include sexually graphic acts . when @entity31 got word of the @entity96 creations , it began working with @entity42 to pull them down . players who repeatedly upload " offensive content " are warned , suspended and eventually banned , @entity55 said . but the policing is n't restricted to @entity31 and @entity42 . users also are able to flag and report content that they find offensive . that angered some content creators , who feel that they should be able to create whatever they want . " it was a totally ridiculous overreaction , " the 37 - year - old web developer said . " i admit it is silly and juvenile , but i do n't think there 's anything perverted , vile or awful about it . if people find it offensive , they can simply not search for it online . no one is forcing anyone to see this content . " in response , he created a site to preserve as many of his naughty creations as possible . he said many other creators of @entity96 have told him that they too were only joking around . but the web developer and other @entity96 creators have had their share of critics . on blogs and message boards , some have called these creators perverts . " i consider this very similar to child pornography , at least to the extent of distributing the material to children , " said 18 - year - old @entity169 from @entity170 , @entity171 . @entity169 said he has flagged about 10 of the " disgusting " creations . @entity31 plans to make sure nobody sees the content if they do n't want to , @entity55 said . when playing " @entity13 , " users will be given three choices regarding people 's creations : to receive no outside content , to receive content from buddies only or to receive all external content . @entity55 hopes the sexual characters do n't spoil " @entity13 " for everyone or get in the way of what she says is a revolutionary game . " user - created content gives players total control over their game experience and empowers them to express their creativity in ways that they never thought possible , " @entity55 said . " it also gives them a powerful emotional connection to the game , since they 've created the world from scratch . " @entity205 , a gamer attending the @entity207 who has created tons of " clean " characters on his own , is glad to know @entity31 will be regulating what makes it into the game . @entity205 is eagerly awaiting the game 's september 7 release . and if by chance a @entity59 character shows up in his virtual " @entity13 " world , he has a plan . " my initial reaction to discovering it in my final game would be to ban it so it would n't show up again and then blow it to pieces for the sheer satisfaction of it , " @entity205 said . " go ahead , create a walking phallus . see how long it lasts in the databases and galaxies of ' @entity13 . ' "
